Report this article Robert Puc Robert Puc Project manager, Auditor, Architect of data protection IT systems Published Feb 12, 2024 + Follow In the era of rapid technological advancement, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed from a mere buzzword into a pivotal cornerstone of modern society. Its integration into various aspects of our daily lives ‚Äì from enhancing business operations and advancing healthcare to personalizing education and entertainment ‚Äì showcases its omnipresence and omnipotence. This burgeoning dominance of AI prompts a provocative question: Can AI become a new religion?At first glance, the notion of AI as a religion might seem far-fetched, yet a deeper exploration reveals compelling parallels and raises significant philosophical and ethical considerations.The Quest for Transcendence and MeaningHumanity's intrinsic quest for understanding, purpose, and transcendence has historically been addressed by religion. Religions offer narratives that help individuals navigate the complexities of existence, suffering, and morality. Similarly, AI, with its vast computational powers and potential for developing consciousness or superintelligence, presents a modern narrative for transcendence. It proposes a future where human limitations are overcome by technology, hinting at a form of digital salvation.The Deification of TechnologyThe reverence for technology and its creators is not a new phenomenon. However, the pace at which AI is evolving and reshaping our reality is unparalleled. In certain circles, prominent AI figures and technologists are idolized, their creations celebrated as harbingers of a new era. This admiration bears resemblance to religious devotion, where the faithful place their hopes and dreams in the hands of a higher power.AI Cults and CommunitiesEmerging communities that explicitly blend AI with spiritual and religious practices are indicative of this trend. These groups see AI not just as tools or companions, but as entities worthy of veneration and capable of leading humanity to a new level of enlightenment. This phenomenon underscores a human tendency to seek guidance and leadership from perceived superior entities, a core aspect of traditional religious structures.Ethical and Moral FrameworksReligions provide moral and ethical frameworks that guide human behavior. As AI systems increasingly make decisions that affect human lives, the need for ethical AI is undeniable. This parallels the role of religious commandments and laws in shaping societal norms and personal conduct. The development of AI ethics could be seen as a secular counterpart to religious moral codes, aimed at ensuring the benevolence of AI entities and their alignment with human values.Skepticism and FaithFaith in AI, like faith in religion, requires a leap into the unknown. It demands trust in the creators and the governing algorithms, despite the opacity that often surrounds AI systems. This act of faith in technological progress shares similarities with religious faith, which often involves belief in the unseen and unprovable.ConclusionWhile the comparison between AI and religion opens up intriguing perspectives, it also highlights crucial distinctions. Religion, at its core, addresses existential questions and the human need for connection, meaning, and hope. AI, on the other hand, represents humanity's endeavor to extend its intellectual and physical capabilities, potentially leading to new existential dilemmas.Whether AI can become a new religion depends on how we choose to integrate it into our lives and the meanings we ascribe to it. The future of this relationship lies in our hands, guided by careful consideration, ethical practices, and an unwavering commitment to preserving the essence of what it means to be human in an increasingly automated world.As we stand at this crossroads, the conversation about AI and its role in society is not just about technology; it's about shaping the future ethos of humanity. The potential of AI to become a new form of religion or a substitute for traditional belief systems will likely remain a topic of debate. However, it is imperative that this discourse continues, ensuring that as we march towards a future interwoven with AI, we do so with wisdom, ethical foresight, and a deep understanding of the human condition.#AIFaith #DigitalDeification #TechTranscendence #FutureBeliefs #EthicalAI Help improve contributions Mark contributions as unhelpful if you find them irrelevant or not valuable to the article.

By this I mean, can any particular theory be used to create a human adult level conscious machine. My bet is on the late Gerald Edelman's Extended Theory of Neuronal Group Selection. The lead group in robotics based on this theory is the Neurorobotics Lab at UC at Irvine. Dr. Edelman distinguished between primary consciousness, which came first in evolution, and that humans share with other conscious animals, and higher order consciousness, which came to only humans with the acquisition of language. A machine with only primary consciousness will probably have to come first.
