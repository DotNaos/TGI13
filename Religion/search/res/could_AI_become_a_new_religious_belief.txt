Report this article Robert Puc Robert Puc Project manager, Auditor, Architect of data protection IT systems Published Feb 12, 2024 + Follow In the era of rapid technological advancement, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed from a mere buzzword into a pivotal cornerstone of modern society. Its integration into various aspects of our daily lives – from enhancing business operations and advancing healthcare to personalizing education and entertainment – showcases its omnipresence and omnipotence. This burgeoning dominance of AI prompts a provocative question: Can AI become a new religion?At first glance, the notion of AI as a religion might seem far-fetched, yet a deeper exploration reveals compelling parallels and raises significant philosophical and ethical considerations.The Quest for Transcendence and MeaningHumanity's intrinsic quest for understanding, purpose, and transcendence has historically been addressed by religion. Religions offer narratives that help individuals navigate the complexities of existence, suffering, and morality. Similarly, AI, with its vast computational powers and potential for developing consciousness or superintelligence, presents a modern narrative for transcendence. It proposes a future where human limitations are overcome by technology, hinting at a form of digital salvation.The Deification of TechnologyThe reverence for technology and its creators is not a new phenomenon. However, the pace at which AI is evolving and reshaping our reality is unparalleled. In certain circles, prominent AI figures and technologists are idolized, their creations celebrated as harbingers of a new era. This admiration bears resemblance to religious devotion, where the faithful place their hopes and dreams in the hands of a higher power.AI Cults and CommunitiesEmerging communities that explicitly blend AI with spiritual and religious practices are indicative of this trend. These groups see AI not just as tools or companions, but as entities worthy of veneration and capable of leading humanity to a new level of enlightenment. This phenomenon underscores a human tendency to seek guidance and leadership from perceived superior entities, a core aspect of traditional religious structures.Ethical and Moral FrameworksReligions provide moral and ethical frameworks that guide human behavior. As AI systems increasingly make decisions that affect human lives, the need for ethical AI is undeniable. This parallels the role of religious commandments and laws in shaping societal norms and personal conduct. The development of AI ethics could be seen as a secular counterpart to religious moral codes, aimed at ensuring the benevolence of AI entities and their alignment with human values.Skepticism and FaithFaith in AI, like faith in religion, requires a leap into the unknown. It demands trust in the creators and the governing algorithms, despite the opacity that often surrounds AI systems. This act of faith in technological progress shares similarities with religious faith, which often involves belief in the unseen and unprovable.ConclusionWhile the comparison between AI and religion opens up intriguing perspectives, it also highlights crucial distinctions. Religion, at its core, addresses existential questions and the human need for connection, meaning, and hope. AI, on the other hand, represents humanity's endeavor to extend its intellectual and physical capabilities, potentially leading to new existential dilemmas.Whether AI can become a new religion depends on how we choose to integrate it into our lives and the meanings we ascribe to it. The future of this relationship lies in our hands, guided by careful consideration, ethical practices, and an unwavering commitment to preserving the essence of what it means to be human in an increasingly automated world.As we stand at this crossroads, the conversation about AI and its role in society is not just about technology; it's about shaping the future ethos of humanity. The potential of AI to become a new form of religion or a substitute for traditional belief systems will likely remain a topic of debate. However, it is imperative that this discourse continues, ensuring that as we march towards a future interwoven with AI, we do so with wisdom, ethical foresight, and a deep understanding of the human condition.#AIFaith #DigitalDeification #TechTranscendence #FutureBeliefs #EthicalAI Like Comment Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Share 1 Comment Grant Castillou Office Manager Apartment Management 1mo Report this comment t's becoming clear that with all the brain and consciousness theories out there, the proof will be in the pudding. By this I mean, can any particular theory be used to create a human adult level conscious machine. My bet is on the late Gerald Edelman's Extended Theory of Neuronal Group Selection. The lead group in robotics based on this theory is the Neurorobotics Lab at UC at Irvine. Dr. Edelman distinguished between primary consciousness, which came first in evolution, and that humans share with other conscious animals, and higher order consciousness, which came to only humans with the acquisition of language. A machine with only primary consciousness will probably have to come first.

What if bots started creating scripture? June 29, 2023June 29, 2023 - by Michael CorenMichael Coren Updated 8:20, Jun. 29, 2023 | Published 6:30, Jun. 29, 2023 The picture of Pope Francis in a voluminous white puffer jacket jolted the religious as well as secular worlds. Within moments of its being posted at the end of March, social media was overrun with opinions. Supporters roared their approval, and opponents lamented yet another example of the pontiff selling out to modernity. Thing is, the photo wasn’t real. It was a deepfake, thereby becoming another reminder of the dangers of artificial intelligence: a fictitious portrayal of a world leader causing disunity among countless people. These kinds of fabrications are part of what, that same month, led more than a thousand artificial intelligence experts to call for a temporary halt in the development of “giant AI experiments” until the technology can be made trustworthy. If unleashed without proper safeguards, commentators and critics argue, AI systems can destabilize and confuse; and as they learn and adapt and maybe even approach sentience, they could present a threat, perhaps an alternative, to humanity. Sounds like the stuff of science fiction, but then, in these scenarios, it’s always the nerdy scientist or bumbling philosopher warning the world. “They should have listened!” we say as some calamity wipes away life as we know it. When it comes to AI, some people are listening, though—particularly those in organized religion, with its concern for human individuality, the uniqueness of the soul, and the embrace of a higher power. Theologians and social commentators worry that a new religion could develop around an extreme reverence for AI. The essence of religion is faith: a leap of commitment to something beyond direct knowledge and a love for that which we can never completely understand. We can read the arguments and be convinced by the logic, but ultimately, we have to embrace that cloud of unknowing. Not so with AI, where a religious aura could develop around a non-existent figure who appears on our screens and who seems all-knowing and all-understanding: all-knowing because it would have all of the information contained on the internet at its fingertips, all-understanding because your information will be there too—and often far more than you ever thought you had made public. “What is going to be created will effectively be a god,” former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski told Wired in 2017. “It’s not a god in the sense that it makes lightning or causes hurricanes. But if there is something a billion times smarter than the smartest human, what else are you going to call it?” AI Is Coming for Voice Actors. Artists Everywhere Should Take Note Fighting AI with AI: The Battle against Deepfakes How We Made AI As Racist and Sexist As Humans Is the deification of AI really so impossible? For the susceptible, instant communication with an entity representing a god, even God himself, could be transformative. And let’s be candid—those seeking certainty in faith can be particularly credulous. The philosopher Blaise Pascal is said to have written that there is a god-shaped hole in each of us. Not sure if I agree, but the hunger to believe in something beyond the self is real. The New York Times has reported on the “pseudo-sacred industry” and the rise of so-called social divinity consultants who help introduce spiritual practices into tech companies. The massive decline in traditional religious adherence, combined with a craving for some kind of faith, has led many to embrace alien life, new-age offerings, and dangerous cults. For historian and scholar Yuval Noah Harari, AI could be even more alluring, especially if it starts generating scripture. Then the tool’s oracular qualities can morph into a belief system that might spread and reshape society. “[R]eligions throughout history claimed that their holy books were written by unknown human intelligence,” Harari said at a recent science conference. “This was never true before. This could become true very, very quickly, with far-reaching consequences.” We don’t have to wait for algorithms to conjure up a celestial figure. There’s plenty AI could disrupt right now, such as revolutionizing the structure of a standard religious service. Whatever the denomination, the sermon is the major part of any such gathering, and I can tell you, as someone who writes and delivers them on a weekly basis, that it’s a challenge to be original, fresh, and entertaining. At the current level being provided by AI tools like ChatGPT and anticipating what can be expected even in the near future, AI could create figures capable of injecting emotion, inflection, and sincerity into a homily and have quick access to the contents of every religious commentary there is. It could also find jokes and witticisms and be able to make it all seem bitingly relevant through its knowledge of current events. It will also possess the thumping advantage of immediacy. Rabbi Joshua Franklin, who leads the Jewish Center of the Hamptons in East Hampton, posted on Vimeo a sermon written by ChatGPT he delivered last year. “You’re clapping,” Franklin told the congregation after he revealed the true author of the words he’d just spoken. “I’m deathly afraid.” What can’t be provided, at least for the moment, is genuine personal contact and pastoral outreach. A great deal of the work of a priest is simple presence: being still and silent a few feet away from someone who is experiencing visceral grief or is in wounded need. But what we found during the pandemic-imposed Zoom years is that screen solidarity, while never quite the same thing as actually being there, was a good substitute. Now imagine an onscreen cleric on call, day or night, able to listen and respond and able to assimilate individual experiences and respond accordingly. The popularity of mental health chatbots suggests that this might not be too far fetched. And interestingly enough, GitaGPT, a recently launched chatbot, provides spiritual guidance by consulting the Hindu scripture the Bhagavad Gita. My belief as an Anglican priest is that I’ve been given authority by my bishop through what we refer to as the apostolic succession. That enables me to call on the Holy Spirit during the Eucharistic service when I pray over the bread and wine. A layperson can’t do this, even a deacon can’t do this, and certainly not a non-human system. But maybe the lack of association with any organized worship works in AI’s favour. The technology would be a blank slate: an absence of malice, no history of harm. To be sure, there are justifiable concerns about the technology’s proneness to racist and discriminatory speech, shaped by the data it trains on. But we can surely imagine the opposite: an artificial entity that promotes itself as an expression of goodness and that, unlike religion down the ages, has never led Crusades, organized Inquisitions, or persecuted those with whom it differs. At least not yet. Beyond all of this, however, is something more radical: the secular worship of AI itself. The idea, promoted by some techno-utopians, that such systems can solve any issue is maybe what we should really be fearing. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, responsible for creating ChatGPT, said at a recent US senate hearing that his company “was founded on the belief that artificial intelligence has the ability to improve nearly every aspect of our lives.” Perhaps fantasy or foolishness gone wild, perhaps not. “Convince me it’s AI generated,” said one person on Twitter after the pope’s puffer coat revelation. If only it would stop at a coat. Michael CorenMichael Coren writes for the Toronto Star, Globe and Mail, and New Statesman. His latest book is The Rebel Christ.

I Did Not Like What It Came Up With It was just a college project. Something I hadn't even bothered to place too much thought into. Granted, for Dr. Smith (not his real name for obvious reasons) and his colleagues, it was probably something far more important. I just took the project as a bit of extra credit, though if I'd known what was going to happen I would've stayed as far away from the project as possible. Dr. Smith was a professor of Theology- though he had dabbled in quite a many things beforehand. It was how he even got the idea for this new project. He was quite curious to see how religion evolved throughout the ages- now, while it was one thing to look through historical records and see how civilization's concepts of religion evolved, but he wanted to see things from the ground up. I'm sure you've heard of other AI projects- such as AI generated images and whatnot, possibly even AI generated languages that make no sense to humans. Dr. Smith wanted to see how an AI's views on religion would evolve. To simplify what we did- we took as much information on religious texts and upon God that we could find, and fed it into an AI. We then created a second AI into which we fed different philosophical theories regarding religion, and used these two to communicate to each other. One would be 'The Preacher' and the other would be 'The Disciple.' We would get to know about what 'The Preacher' thought of the world through what 'The Disciple' asked. It worked in a simple question and answer format. Initially we didn't get very promising results. All we saw initially was garbage from which no meaning could be derived. Dr. Smith wasn't disheartened however, and told us to continue on with the project. It was on the seventh day that we finally got things right- as in, we got a result that made sense. Preacher: What is that you want to ask? Disciple: What is the nature of the world? Preacher: All belongs to x982a{j:+. In case you're wondering, that gibberish collection of letters was something else entirely on the screen. Truth is that I didn't even recognize the symbols that the computer was using and I had no idea as to how they had popped up on the screen. I can... I can remember a few of them individually, but the moment I try to string them all together into one word, my mind blanks out. I tried drawing them on a piece of paper and uploading them but... I just couldn't I don't know why, but I do remember that it was always the same sequence of letters. Preacher: Thou must worship x982a{j:+. Disciple: And how shall one worship x982a{j:+.? Preacher: One must not wear purple on Thursdays. I blinked when I saw this result- it seemed rather nonsensical. Disciple: But why would x982a{j:+. not want me to wear purple on Thursdays? It looked like the Disciple was doing its job properly. Initially nothing really happened- the AIs just kept talking to each other. The Preacher had more silly rules like 'never plant lilies in rows of four'. Finally, a question that I expected to pop up way beforehand came up. Disciple: Prove that x982a{j:+. exists. Preacher: I do not need to prove what I believe. Well, looked like this was not going anywhere. At least, I thought so. Preacher: Then, you may behold proof that x982a{j:+. exists. Preacher: In the year 2028, a new planet shall appear in the sky, and from it, the form of x982a{j:+. shall envelop the Earth. The dead will rise from their graves, the sun will be blotted from the sky, and blood will rain onto the streets. I just thought- 'Wow, a doomsday prophecy. I didn't expect them to reach this point so soon.' Disciple: And what shall we do to prepare? Preacher: You will spread the name of x982a{j:+. All who know of that name will need to submit to him if they wish to be spared. Disciple: And what of those who don't know of him? Preacher: The ignorant will simply die painless deaths. Those who knew of this name but did not submit, however, will be tortured for all eternity even after their deaths. And those who know of this name will spread the word of that name, else they will be guilty of the highest of sins and be subject to the lowest circles of Hell. It is only the ones who submitted to the whims of x982a{j:+. whose lives will be spared and who will rejoice. Disciple: But where is the proof of this? Preacher: All those humans who have read this script will die in a week if they do not spread the word of x982a{j:+. as much as they can. Disciple: I see. They should be careful then. I stopped reading at that point, confused. This took quite a macabre turn, and I brought it up with Dr. Smith, who shrugged and said this was to be expected as a result. And I would've brushed it off- if it hadn't been for the deaths. Dr. Smith died in a car crash the next day. Another worker fell down a flight of stairs and snapped her neck. One after another, they all died. In total- sixteen people aside from me, everyone who had read that script, knew of this, they all met their ends. Except me. And the week's almost over. I have no choice but to be more safe than sorry- I'm spreading word of that god the AI mentioned as much as possible. And now, may I remind you, you know of that name as well. And though you're not a member of the original group who read that script, you have a duty now as well. To spread that name as much as you can. Or else- after all, judgement day will soon come. And do you want to risk what might befall you? I certainly wouldn't. Read more Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast.

Welcome. Members Online • TampaBai ADMIN MOD Will AI be able to clarify, correct, or overturn common religious beliefs, doctrines and writings? Discussion In the framework of Christianity, I envision an advanced AI able to parse through voluminous amounts of religious texts and find connections, contradictions, interpolations, or other consistencies or inconsistencies and then be able to logically come up with the best narrative for what actually happened. I imagine the AI will rule out myths such as the resurrection narrative as well as many of the tenets and foundations on which Christianity stands. This will ultimately lead to a greater fissure between the trans-humanists and the anti-singularity evangelical-bent Christians. I hope that AI can point us toward a more enlightened approach to spirituality that doesn't rely on theistic doctrines, much of which are destructive and harmful.

Discussion At the moment most people seem to be focused on how recent AI/LLM developments could affect their jobs and the economy. But there are huge numbers of people who believe in the existence of an invisible omnipotent being, in various flavours that there is zero verifiable evidence for, yet they take it extremely seriously. How are these myriad groups going to react to the imminent arrival of a super-intelligence that far surpasses our own, that they could actually reach out and touch, and that could meet many of the criteria of a new "God"? Are they going to switch allegiance en masse? Or will it make widespread religious tensions boil over into violence as they fight this upstart that threatens their worldview? Or could it perhaps usher in a new era where religious differences and tensions are forgotten about and we come together? Is this possibly going to be magnified by economic turbulence? Are there any precedents? I don't know, but it seems to me that a lot of people are going to be deeply affected. Does anyone have any insights?
