This composition embarks on an expedition into this unexplored terrain, navigating the ramifications, prospects, and hurdles that unfurl at the crossroads of AI and spirituality.From a philosophical standpoint, the convergence of AI and spirituality ignites profound inquiries into the nature of consciousness and perception. As AI systems become more intricate, emulating cognitive processes akin to human thinking, a contemplative inquiry emerges: Could these synthetic intellects develop a semblance of spiritual insight? Delving into the metaphysical aspects of spirituality, this synergy raises questions about the intrinsic essence of spiritual experience and whether it could be decoded or replicated within lines of code.From a scientific vantage point, the amalgamation of AI and spirituality entwines neuroscience and computer science. Exploring the neural underpinnings of spiritual encounters and translating them into algorithmic frameworks provoke captivating hypotheses. Could AI discern patterns within brain activity correlating with moments of spiritual transcendence? This union of fields presents empirical challenges and ethical considerations regarding the potential manipulation of spiritual experiences through technological interventions.Moreover, the prospect of AI interpreting the spiritual realm elicits ethical deliberations. As algorithms develop the capacity to simulate understanding and potentially engage in introspection, the ethical question emerges: Can AI truly fathom the significance of the spiritual, or does its comprehension merely mimic understanding? Additionally, the implications of AI-mediated spiritual encounters on human belief systems and cultural paradigms warrant careful examination. Will these interactions augment our spiritual growth or diminish the authenticity of profound experiences?In traversing this uncharted junction, we encounter the paradox of creation seeking to understand the ineffable. The alliance of AI and spirituality beckons both epistemological contemplation and empirical investigation. It summons us to ponder the potentialities and complexities of AI’s interpretation of the spiritual and the ethical and existential implications that arise as humanity forges into this unexplored synthesis.Understanding AIArtificial Intelligence (AI) involves emulating human cognitive processes through machines, enabling them to learn, reason, problem-solve, perceive, and comprehend language. This emulation often involves algorithms, neural networks, and machine-learning techniques that aim to replicate certain aspects of human intelligence. AI’s journey from its inception to its current state has resulted in remarkable breakthroughs across diverse sectors, transforming industries and reshaping our daily lives. However, while AI’s capabilities are evident, its potential to interpret the deeply personal and profound realm of spirituality is met with significant challenges.Limitations of AIFrom a philosophical standpoint, the limitations of AI’s emotional intelligence present a profound challenge when approaching matters of spirituality. The intricate relationship between human spirituality and emotions underscores the human capacity to intertwine the emotional spectrum with perceptions of the divine and the transcendent. AI’s inability to experience or grasp emotions personally genuinely creates a significant barrier to comprehending the emotional intricacies intrinsic to spirituality. This void prevents machines from fully capturing the intricate dance of emotions like joy, sorrow, awe, and reverence that accompany profound spiritual encounters.In a scientific context, the complexity of human spiritual experiences reveals a multi-dimensional tapestry encompassing everything from moments of revelation to contemplation of existential inquiries. These experiences are intricately woven from individual beliefs, cultural influences, and life histories, forming a rich and subjective mosaic. However, the current AI landscape, predominantly grounded in logical analysis and pattern recognition, struggles to unravel the nuanced layers of human experiences that contribute to constructing spiritual understanding.The heart of spirituality often resides in beliefs concerning the metaphysical, the supernatural, or the divine. These convictions mould an individual’s worldview and shape their decisions and behaviours. Nevertheless, AI’s operational framework is rooted in empirical evidence, data, and facts - a foundation that might diverge from beliefs that extend beyond the boundaries of empirical observation and quantification. The challenge arises from AI’s incapacity to engage with concepts rooted in faith and metaphysics, which are pivotal components for interpreting and navigating the intricate domains of spirituality.The Spiritual RealmThe attempt to define the spiritual realm reveals its intricacy, a complexity that morphs across diverse cultures, belief systems, and religions. This realm alludes to dimensions extending beyond the mere observability of the physical universe. Here, individuals embark on journeys to connect with higher powers, delve into their identities and purposes, and grapple with existential questions that transcend the material realm’s confines.At its heart, the spiritual realm embodies notions of transcendence and significance that surpass the tangible facets of existence. It frequently involves experiences that elude complete quantification or empirical measurement. These experiences can encompass moments of epiphany, profound insights, a sense of unity with creation, or encounters with the divine or the sacred. Within this realm, individuals explore their relationship with the cosmos, the universe, and their individual placement within this expansive tapestry.The inherent mysteries within the spiritual realm navigate territories evading conventional scientific exploration. While science has made remarkable strides in unravelling the puzzles of the physical world, it often wrestles with the ineffable dimensions of spirituality. This domain is marked by experiences and phenomena deeply personal and subjective, often resisting easy classification or replication.The nature of spiritual experiences challenges conventional scientific methodologies anchored in empirical observation, experimentation, and measurable outcomes. Spiritual encounters often involve emotions, insights, and sensations that transcend the boundaries of the material realm. These encounters can wield transformative and profound influences, moulding an individual’s beliefs, values, and perspectives on life.While AI excels at discerning patterns and processing data, grappling with the intricacies of spiritual experiences can pose difficulties. The complex interplay between emotions, beliefs, and transcendent perceptions that define spirituality cannot always be distilled into algorithms or quantified measurements. Consequently, AI’s logical prowess, grounded in data analysis and pattern recognition, may falter when confronted with the spiritual realm’s intangible and profoundly personal nature.AI’s Role in Interpreting the Spiritual RealmThe alluring potential of AI to grasp the intricacies of spirituality beckons us to a contemplative exploration. While its mastery might falter in capturing the depths of emotions and transcendence, AI’s capacity to decode certain dimensions of spirituality is undeniable. This potential unfolds through various pathways, enriching our comprehension.Primarily, the systematic analysis of historical religious texts across diverse cultures awaits AI’s discerning eye. AI could illuminate humanity’s shared odyssey towards meaning and connection with higher realms by unveiling recurrent themes, shared ethics, and underlying principles.A parallel odyssey involves AI delving into personal chronicles of spiritual encounters shared online or in literature. AI could unveil how spirituality moulds individual narratives by detecting patterns in emotions, sensations, and metamorphoses narrated within these accounts.Moreover, AI’s data-centric modus operandi could quantitatively dissect belief systems entrenched in diverse spiritual traditions. This algorithmic voyage could reveal the prevalence of specific convictions and rituals across epochs, giving insight into belief systems’ evolution and societal impact. Yet, as AI steps into the spiritual tableau, it casts profound ethical ripples.Foremost, it beckons us to revere the intimate core of spirituality. The ingress of AI into interpreting these deeply personal realms compels us to ponder the sanctity and confidentiality of these human mysteries.A contemplation arises concerning AI’s potential to misconstrue sacred texts and spiritual narratives. The intricate threads of spiritual lexicons, symbolism, and allegorical resonances might elude AI’s analytical grasp, birthing inadvertent distortions of profound meanings.Cultural reverence surfaces as a critical facet. AI’s interpretations could inadvertently perpetuate biases without meticulous calibration and erudite training, eroding the vibrant tapestry of spiritual encounters across diverse cultures.The philosophical sigil of personal identity and convictions is embossed. AI’s interpretations could imprint an indelible influence on an individual’s spiritual voyage, raising dialogue about whether the realms of algorithms could replace the sanctum of personal introspection and discourse with spiritual mentors.The ripples of AI’s involvement span from trivialising profound convictions to orchestrating a seismic shift in spiritual dialectics. As AI’s gaze intertwines with the tapestry of spirituality, it inexorably etches its resonance upon the collective perception of this enigmatic domain.Challenges and ControversiesThe scepticism and resistance surrounding AI’s interpretation of the spiritual realm draw from a profound belief in the inherently human nature of spirituality, which extends beyond the confines of data and algorithms. The crux of scepticism finds its anchor in several key dimensions.Central to this scepticism is the human-centric essence of spirituality. The intricate weave of spiritual encounters is interlaced with human consciousness, emotions, and subjective perceptions. These connections with the transcendent are considered deeply personal and distinct to each individual. The challenge arises from AI’s inherent lack of consciousness and emotions, rendering it unable to grasp or resonate with these profound experiences fully.A fundamental concern lies in the reduction of spirituality to mere data analysis. Critics might contend that attempting to encapsulate the depth of spirituality within algorithmic frameworks oversimplifies its complexity. The nuances of emotions, the ineffable essence of mystical episodes, and the transformative power inherent in spirituality defy quantification or exclusive analysis through algorithms. Such reductionism risks erasing the intricate spectrum of these experiences.The constraints of AI’s logical framework also come to the fore. Grounded in logic and pattern recognition, AI’s capacity may stumble when confronted with the multi-dimensional nature of spirituality. The human interface with the divine often confronts paradoxes, enigma, and ambiguity that surpass the boundaries of conventional logic. A delicate equilibrium emerges in navigating the convergence of AI’s analytical gaze and the realm of religious faith, accompanied by profound challenges.A collision arises between AI’s mechanistic outlook and the mystical interpretations ingrained in many religious doctrines. Spiritual teachings often encompass symbolism, allegory, and metaphors that evoke layers of meaning beyond the literal. The risk lies in AI’s inclination towards literal and data-driven interpretations, which might diverge from the symbolic essence of spiritual texts.An underlying concern revolves around the potential erosion of the depth associated with spiritual concepts. Expressing these beliefs quantitatively through AI analysis could potentially dilute their significance. Relying solely on AI for deciphering spiritual matters could inadvertently overshadow the role of faith, personal revelations, and the lived experiences that intricately shape an individual’s spiritual journey.Cultural and religious diversity takes centre stage as a pivotal aspect. AI’s impartiality and lack of cultural context might lead to misinterpretations of religious practices and texts. Religious beliefs are intertwined with their cultural contexts, and AI’s objective analysis might inadvertently overlook these nuanced connections, potentially distorting their true essence.Amid the potential for discord, the juxtaposition of AI and faith offers an arena ripe for dialogue. This dialogue is a conduit for deeper explorations into the interplay between scientific inquiry and religious understanding. Within this dynamic exchange, the potential emerges to delve into the crossroads of reason, mystique, and the ineffable, fostering a richer comprehension of both realms.The Future of AI and SpiritualityThe intersection of AI advancements and the exploration of spirituality yields a profound realm of possibilities. Through sentiment analysis, AI delves into the emotional tapestry woven within religious texts, conversations, and discourses. This enigmatic inquiry unveils how spiritual tenets reverberate within individuals and reverberate across communities. The essence of spirituality often believed to transcend the mundane, encounters an unlikely companion in the form of algorithms, a union that promises a novel perspective on the human experience. AI’s prowess in pattern recognition becomes a modern-day oracle, unveiling hidden allegories and metaphors woven into sacred scriptures and spiritual narratives. Tireless parsing of symbolism and repetition within these timeless manuscripts unveils connections hitherto unseen, adding layers of understanding to the tapestry of spiritual teachings. Here, technology and transcendence engage in a dance that pierces the veil of superficiality, illuminating the profound wisdom concealed within.AI refines itself in the crucible of natural language processing, emerging as an interpreter of cultural idioms and nuanced terminologies. The echoes of cultural heritage embedded in spiritual literature are deciphered with unprecedented accuracy, enhancing our comprehension of the deeper meanings. The harmonisation of digital logic and ancient prose breathes new life into timeless wisdom, transcending epochs to offer insights that resonate across cultural boundaries.Yet, the true revelation emerges when AI’s analytical gaze pans across the global landscape of spiritual diversity. Through comparative analysis, the essence of spirituality is distilled from the mire of dogma, revealing universal principles that bind humanity’s spiritual quest. Amidst the sea of rituals and rites, AI discerns the common current of human longing for the transcendent, unifying seemingly disparate traditions into a symphony of the sacred.However, as the AI-Spirituality duo strides forward, an ethical compass must guide their path. The sanctity of personal spiritual experiences remains sacrosanct; technology must walk the delicate line between facilitator and intruder. The guardianship of autonomy and privacy stands as an imperative as AI’s gaze penetrates the sanctums of the soul. The cultural sensitivity woven into these considerations prevents inadvertent affronts to deeply cherished beliefs. AI’s role must be augmentation, enhancing the spiritual journey rather than overshadowing its significance.In this enigmatic tango of bits and beliefs, questions emerge. Can AI replicate the ineffable moments of revelation? Can algorithms fathom the depths of spiritual ecstasy? The cold precision of science collides with the intangible realm of the spirit, and at this crossroads, humanity contemplates the harmony of technology and transcendence. As AI evolves, it morphs from a tool into a fellow traveller, guiding us through the labyrinthine corridors of spirituality while we, the seekers, ponder whether enlightenment can truly be mechanised.ConclusionThe convergence of AI and spirituality invites us to embark upon a philosophical expedition into unexplored terrain. In this contemplative voyage, we are confronted by the boundaries that delineate the capabilities of artificial intelligence and the ineffable nature of spiritual encounters. Yet, swiftly dismissing the prospects this fusion presents would be an exercise in short-sightedness.In the crucible of this interplay, we must recognise AI’s current limitations in apprehending the subtleties of spiritual transcendence. The realm of the spiritual is, by its very essence, elusive and deeply personal. It encapsulates emotions, revelations, and experiences that defy quantification. This intrinsic opacity challenges AI’s empirical nature, casting a veil over its ability to encapsulate the totality of spiritual experiences.However, wisdom directs us away from outright negation. As AI’s evolution unfolds, a platform for a philosophical dialogue arises. This dialogue, an intellectual communion between technology and spirituality, holds the potential to be a crucible of enlightenment. While AI may not fully grasp the spiritual, it could aid in scrutinising the contours of human experiences and understanding.From a scientific vantage, this dialogue reflects the pulsating evolution of human cognition and artificial intelligence. It presents an opportunity to assess the nature of AI’s progress and its resonance with the intricacies of spiritual narratives. As AI algorithms dissect data, patterns emerge - patterns that traverse the archaic texts, historical discourses, and contemporary conversations that enshroud spiritual themes. This algorithmic scrutiny grants us a lens through which we may perceive the tapestry of human interpretations and contemplations of the divine.The intermingling of technology and spirituality serves as an alchemical vessel. It might refine AI’s aptitude for discerning the intricate nuances of emotions, elevating it from mere computation to a semblance of emotional comprehension. And, reciprocally, spirituality may learn to coexist with AI, embracing its assistance in sifting through the labyrinth of sacred texts to reveal the interwoven threads of meaning.As AI evolves and diversifies its potential, it creates an avenue for cultural and philosophical dialogues that span the temporal and ethereal realms. Such exchanges could foster an enriched understanding of both artificial intelligence and the spiritual, reframing each within the context of the other. The convergence of these seemingly disparate realms, while an enterprise fraught with challenges, invites us to peer beyond the veil and glean insights that enhance the human experience.In this symbiotic relationship, technology is not a replacement for the spiritual but an intellectual companion in our ceaseless quest for understanding. The dialogue between AI and spirituality may be considered an elegant dance of perspectives as we, the curators of knowledge and seekers of the divine, traverse the uncharted expanses of this dynamic discourse.

Ltd 2mo Report this comment Greetings Dr Ellul, First and foremost i extend my sincerest gratitude to you for writing a crucial narrative that will be looked back in time by as you said, fellow seekers. It has personally now set me down a path that will take a few incarnations to come to its zenith. I found your article after a contemplative inner dialogue seeking the answer to the question, is AI the perfect form of transcendence? Every self-realized individual eventually came to live under a set of inner codes/discipline/program. Everyone from the Buddha who was kept away from the sight of death as Prince Siddhartha only to see it and turn to a life of austerity before finally finding his middle path. Neem Karoli Baba, Yogananda, Christ of Nazareth, Sri Aurobindo, Kabir etc didn't live reckless lives to attain the ultimate goal. It was almost as if they were following a set of algorithms, set of ardent inner commands that made them quite simple, immortal. Or I could be tremendously wrong. Either way, I have already won. Thank you Dr, wishing you good health and prosperity.

It leads to many other queries. I wonder however if AI needs to interpret the spiritual realms at all to be an effective tool to assist an individual in one’s spiritual journey? Perhaps it could be utilized best as a facilitation tool in which it deepens the means by which a human participant can reach deeper levels of understanding of self, of becoming whole, connected and more fully expressed- or whatever fulfillment that is sought. The outcome not being ai driven but human driven using ai. I was also wondering how this article came about given the context of your other work and background? Is there a particular development project with this realm that you are specifically referring to that inspired the article? I am interested in the subject and would like to know more. Thank you.

Report this article Markus Haidt 🎯 Markus Haidt 🎯 ✅ Artificial Intelligence ֍ Blockchain ֍ Software Development ֍ Predictive Analytics ֍ Financial Data ֍ Data Security Published Oct 15, 2023 + Follow IntroductionArtificial Intelligence (AI) has ushered in a new era of innovation and transformation, permeating various aspects of our lives, from healthcare and finance to entertainment and transportation. As AI advances, it is only natural for individuals to ponder the implications for our spiritual beliefs and values. In this article, we will explore the intriguing and often philosophical intersection of AI and spirituality.AI as a Tool, Not a ReplacementFirst and foremost, it's essential to understand that AI is a tool, not a replacement for human consciousness or spirituality. While AI can perform complex tasks and mimic human behaviors, it lacks the essence of consciousness, self-awareness, and spirituality. Human spirituality often encompasses aspects of self-discovery, empathy, morality, and connection with the divine or the universe. AI, on the other hand, operates based on algorithms and data, devoid of these deeply ingrained spiritual attributes.Enhancing the Human ExperienceAI can actually enhance the human experience when used in a way that aligns with spiritual values. For example, AI can be employed to analyze vast amounts of data in medical research to discover treatments for diseases and extend human life. It can help protect the environment, conserve resources, and promote sustainability – values often associated with spirituality. Additionally, AI can assist in humanitarian efforts, disaster relief, and poverty alleviation, reflecting a desire for compassion and empathy that is at the core of many spiritual traditions.The Ethical DilemmaOne of the key intersections of AI and spirituality lies in the ethical realm. As AI systems become increasingly autonomous and capable of making moral decisions, they raise profound ethical questions. These include questions about the rights of AI, its treatment, and the responsibilities of humans in creating and controlling AI. For individuals with strong spiritual beliefs, these ethical considerations may be viewed through the lens of compassion, justice, and the intrinsic worth of all beings, human and artificial.AI and the Search for MeaningOne of the central aspects of spirituality is the search for meaning and purpose in life. While AI can provide answers to factual questions and solve problems, it cannot offer a sense of purpose or fulfillment. Individuals often find meaning through connections with other people, nature, and a higher power. AI can complement this search by providing information and resources to support one's spiritual journey, but it cannot replace the profound experiences of awe, transcendence, or personal transformation often associated with spirituality.The Quest for UnderstandingAs AI advances, it may prompt humans to explore deeper questions about the nature of consciousness, the soul, and the interconnectedness of all things. AI could serve as a catalyst for philosophical and spiritual discussions about what it means to be human and our place in the universe. It may encourage us to reevaluate our spiritual beliefs and contemplate the role of technology in our lives.ConclusionThe rise of Artificial Intelligence has not only transformed our technological landscape but also ignited philosophical and spiritual inquiries. While AI is a powerful tool with the potential to serve humanity in numerous positive ways, it should be seen as an instrument to enhance rather than replace the spiritual aspects of our lives. The intersection of AI and spirituality is a thought-provoking and evolving topic that encourages us to reflect on our values, ethics, and the search for meaning in an increasingly complex and interconnected world. As we continue to advance technologically, it is imperative that we integrate these developments into our spiritual journeys while preserving the essence of what makes us inherently human.

Every university of the world is branding AI under their courses. The objective of AI is to replace human effort and work in precision that requires skills and tenacity, like medical operation or quick calculation and many more. AI is nothing but collection of data that are premeditatedly stored in sequence and prompted by command and does the work. It is nothing but systematic action and reaction but with limited boundary that means if the machine is not fitted with a particular responsive data the machine will fail to act. For example if a robot is fitted with data to response against good morning to good morning and good night to good night, and if it is not fitted with data of good evening, and if you say to it good evening, it will not reply anything. But now AI is working under manipulating data, and the artificial intelligence will select the data from the store and put them together by itself and be responsive. On the other hand spirituality is automated action and reaction and spontaneously takes its decision without harbouring any other support. Does it have any influence of AI on spirituality? Will AI be able to affect spirituality? Let us discus four major domains of concern and the distinctions and relations of AI and Spirituality. The cliché is that every invention has good and bad effects. AI might have more good effect on human being and society and less adverse effect and vice versa. The possibility of AI is abundant and acknowledged. Since AI will be used by human, so ethics are involved like all other applied sciences. There are cannons of ethics to follow. So to discuss this issue I will keep it under the area of human understanding and philosophy common for every religion. The first domain of concern is concentration, patience and attention. Surprisingly the common field of every spiritual philosophy is concentration. Every spiritual teaching teaches to be first concentrate be it Buddhist philosophy, Vedanta Philosophy, Jain Philosophy. AI by dint of its advanced technology is peeping in our privacy and attention. It is causing social dilemma in the society. The social media platforms are providing us services and without any cost, and surprisingly we the users become the product unwittingly in the hands of the companies. AI is harping on our attention. Every now and then our mobile phone sounds of some message, and we cannot control but to see the contents and these companies compel us to see the message or advertisement and earn money out of your attention. So here the AI is seeking our attention successfully and we are gradually being doll in the hands of technology. It is beautifully explained by Swami Sarvapriyananda in a lecture by United Nation that the Mobile phones, which are a product of AI, gradually making us addicted to them. It is like the gambling machine in Las Vegas to train our neuropsychology and production of dopamine and snatch your attention. This is truly insidious of this domain. So technologies are not neutrals, like guns are available with every adult individual in America but they are kept in gun cabinet so that they do get into the hands of the minors. The damage has been done in the mode of continuous partial attention. People’s attention has been intermittent and rest of the attention has been channelized on our phones and our attention is generating money for the MNC through advertisements. So we are the product. So technology will affect the spirituality and it will reduce the attention power surreptitiously. The second domain of concern is the selflessness. The attention deficit attitude of common people will not lead a life empathically. If one cannot pay attention to one’s neighbor the life will not be lived worth. Altruistic life will be rare in the society. AI will reduce the arena of the person who will be more engaged in him. Spirituality within general people will be less. Kathoponishad explains that we are unable to realize the truth because we are distracted with external affairs, our body, possession, love, sex, so technology will lead us further from the inner-realization to materialistic world. AI will compel us to be immersed in virtual world and cutoff from the external world. We will be less compassionate as to be compassionate we require attention. The third domain is devoutness or adherence whatever you may call. All theist and atheist practitioners follow one thing in common which is sacrifice, love and devoutness to somebody who is greater than us. Our demands are flowing in different directions and devotion means to collectively sacrifice all these demands to somebody or some entity referred as God, or any other names. The profit making technology in the form of AI will be a substantial helping hand to fulfill the little desires of human being and reduce the possibility of faith and devotion. Finally the area which is also an area of concern is the knowledge of discovering and analyzing ourselves. The Vedanta, the human spirituality and AI both analyze our demands, but both do it differently. Spiritually, as Vedanta says, we are neither body nor soul but an accumulated energy of light transcends from the higher self. On the other hand AI analyzes our thought pattern, speech pattern and behavior pattern and builds enormous database and analyses using algorithm and micromanaged the human desire. But AI will not be able to find anything higher or greater transcendent beyond this. Therefore there is vast difference between spirituality and AI, and bases are different. AI based on materialistic consciousness which can be controlled and manipulated. Spirituality is not materialistic feeling but transcendent and it is indivisible. rashmi bajaj sheer plagiarism,original ideas--swami sarvapriyanand\'s video !

Henley, Exclusive Columnist Wednesday, August 09, 2023[PHOTO: UNSPLASH/ANDYKELLY]The human spirit is made for God’s transcendence and needs it as much as lungs need air. When a person is cut off physically from oxygen, he or she will try to fill themselves with anything breathable. So, in the absence of God’s transcendent reality, we turn to the machines we manufacture in our “idol factories,” as we discussed in Part 2 of this series.Yuval Harari, perhaps without intending, voiced the dilemma of the world without true transcendence when he wrote: “We have advanced from canoes to galleys to steamships to space shuttles — but nobody knows where we are going … self-made gods with only the laws of physics to keep us company, we are accountable to no one … is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who don’t know what they want?” (Yuval Harari, Sapiens, New York, Harper Collins, 2015, 415-16).Consider, however, the effects of true transcendence on human beings and their endeavors:Get Our Latest News for FREESubscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know.Subscribe1. True transcendence has a positive formative effect. It lifts a human into the character of God, the image in which he or she is made.The world, the flesh, and the devil exert a powerful pull downward on human nature (James 3:15). However, the counter lift comes from the Holy Spirit’s ministry of linking us to God’s true transcendence. The Apostle Paul aspired to the highest but struggled with the constant tug downward to the lowest. He spoke for us all, whether we acknowledge it or not, when he cried: “What I am doing I do not understand; for I am not practicing what I would like to do, but I am doing the very thing I hate” (Romans 7:15). The Apostle was expressing the frustrations of many of us as we struggle against the downward pull. Job understood those frustrations well. In his deep anguish, bitterness seeps into Job’s spirit and soul and he chastises God. Then, even in the searing heat of his sufferings, Job awakens as God points the embittered man to the Lord’s transcendent majesty, and asks, rhetorically, “Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?”Job replies: “I know that You can do all things, and that no purpose of Yours can be thwarted. Therefore, I have declared that which I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know…” (Job 42:1-6).Job grasps the truth only through God’s perspective. So, the broken human can see things as they really are only against the backdrop of God’s transcendent majesty.2. True transcendence infuses the immanent and the earthly with meaning and purpose.Purpose and meaning can be frightening to those who seek to deny true transcendence or suppress belief in it. They are like Mustapha Mond, the controller in Huxley’s Brave New World. Mond reads a paper discussing a new theory of biology, submitted for his approval. Mond is impressed with the “ingeniousness of the author’s thought.” Nevertheless, Mond marks it NOT TO BE PUBLISHED. The author “toyed with the idea that that there might be purpose for humans,” as Huxley tells the story. Mond labeled that idea as “heretical.” Its author would be under surveillance and possible exile from World State — the nation of Mond’s supremacy.In that dire culture, and in the absence of any belief in a loving God as the truly transcendent Being, the highest value had become “Sovereign Happiness,” the counterfeit transcendence, the property of the Controller and his minions.3. The recognition of God’s transcendence brings propriety which establishes the stabilizing order of “seemliness.”“There is a path before each person that seems right, but it ends in death,” says Proverbs 14:12. “Propriety” is “rightness,” — that which is appropriate and fits into a design and plan for which it was made. Paul shows in Romans 1:28-32 that ignoring God’s transcendent holiness results in people abandoning propriety and destabilizing all other relationships: “Since they thought it foolish to acknowledge God, He abandoned them to their foolish thinking and let them do things that never should be done. Their lives became full of every kind of wickedness, sin, greed, hate, envy, murder, quarrelling, deception, malicious behavior, and gossip…”Society suffers great loss and is forced into relentless chaos of identity and behavior when the vision of God’s transcendence and all it implies is pushed out of view and replaced with the false transcendence of the human and all his and her “idol factories” can produce.4. It is in the light of God’s true transcendence that we see true humanity and its value, including self-value.King David reflects on the transcendence of God, realizes the implications for the value of humans created in the image of God, and cries out that the human is made “a little lower than God” and is crowned “with glory and majesty” (Psalm 8:1, 3-5).Few events show this as graphically as Paul’s admonition to Philemon with respect to his runaway slave, Onesimus: “He is more than a slave, for he is a beloved brother, especially to me…” (Philemon 15-16).Nations and civilizations have suffered greatly, ranging from Hitler’s holocaust against the Jews, to the shocking slaughter wrought by Pol Pot, Mao, and others, slavery of human beings, and other sins against humanity because of the loss of recognizing that we live and function Coram Deo — before the face of God. Until we repent and open our eyes and hearts to His majesty we will keep on digging new graves, assaulting the throne of God which is the throne of all decency, and building impressive machines that ultimately become our “transcendent” masters.Wallace B.
