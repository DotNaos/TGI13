Religions and Artificial Intelligence (AI) | Institut für Religionswissenschaft | Universität Heidelberg German Research Events Publications Projects Media contributions Networking Universität Heidelberg > ZEGK > IRW > Religions and Artificial Intelligence (AI) Developments in artificial intelligence are in the process of fundamentally transforming our planet, our society, and us as individuals. Our perception of humanness, our understanding of intelligence and consciousness, as well as how we live together is being shaken by AI. The disruptive power of AI also has severe effects on Religion. Artificial Intelligence is transforming religious institutions, movements, discourses, practices and actors. Independent of their religiosity all actors are completely involved in neu digital technologies. In order to not be helplessly subjected to the new technologies and the elites which utilize them, the modes of action of the discourses and practices of AI must be decoded. Thus, the diagnostic potential of Religious studies should be applied in two areas. For one, the broad spectrum of interactions between religion and AI should be investigated. For another, the theories and findings of religious studies should be applied to AI as a formation analogous to religion. Questions about the interactions between religion and artificial intelligence can be further divided into two areas: AI and religion and AI as religion. The former thematic block focusses in the influence of AI on religions, for example in mission and administration, in the use of AI (examples include religion in Apps or as the use of robots as priests), and in the transformation of religious beliefs and practices, such as in the form of new religious movements. Further, artificial intelligence can be investigated as a challenge to images of humans which are contingent on religion and culture and also as an impulse for theological processes of the conception of oneself (theologische Selbstverständigungsprozesse). The latter thematic block is concerned with the discourses and practices of AI as a formation analogous to religion. Key research questions point towards the religious rhetoric and soteriological promises of the discourses about AI, as well as the core functions of AI and the algorithms which AI can produce. To investigate these questions, we must work with the discourse and ideology critical approaches of religious studies. With the help of multimethodological approaches, the societal dynamics and social consequences of AI can be presented and discussed. The material religion approach helps to consider the so far often neglected anthropological dimensions of AI-praxis. Aspects of gender-theory can generate insights about the effects of androcentric research into AI, as well as take the so far barely considered differences between male and female realities and the transformations of these realities through AI into account.

When AI is used in religious practices and organizations, the good and bad effects must be considered.One good thing about AI in religion is that it can connect people worldwide so they can access religious teachings and practices no matter where they are. For example, religious institutions can use AI to create virtual religious experiences and connect with their followers more personally and effectively. Also, AI-powered virtual assistants can be used to answer religious questions so that more people can learn about religion.However, there are also concerns about the implications of AI in religion. Some argue that AI has the potential to replace traditional religious practices and institutions, leading to a decrease in human connection and community. Additionally, the use of AI in religion raises ethical concerns, such as whether or not AI can be used to make religious decisions or if it is appropriate to use AI in spiritual practices.Real-life examples of AI in religion include the creation of prayer chatbots, such as the Jewish prayer chatbot developed by Tel Aviv University, which allows users to input a prayer request and receive a personalized prayer in return. The "Buddha Bot" is another example. It is an AI-powered device that says Buddhist mantras and gives instructions on how to meditate.As the integration of AI in religion continues to grow, it is crucial to consider the impacts and implications that it may have on religious practices and beliefs. Addressing these concerns and finding ways to integrate AI thoughtfully and ethically, the intersection of AI and religion can offer new and exciting opportunities for spiritual growth and development.References:“AI and Religion: When Technology Meets Spirituality” by The Tech“The Intersection of AI and Religion” by Harvard Divinity SchoolJewish prayer chatbot developed by Tel Aviv University https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/technology/tel-aviv-university-develops-ai-chatbot-for-jewish-prayer-655193“How artificial intelligence is shaping religion in the 21st century” by The Conversation Like Comment Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Share To view or add a comment, sign in More articles by this author No more previous content Leviathans of the Deep: AI's Autonomous Armada Redefining Naval Warfare Mar 15, 2024 AI's Stealth Warriors: Unveiling the Rise of Autonomous Combat Systems in Modern Warfare Mar 14, 2024 Skynet Awakens: AI Drones Unleashing a New Era of Air Supremacy Mar 13, 2024 The Swarm Effect: How AI-Powered Drone Fleets are Revolutionizing Modern Warfare Mar 12, 2024 The Silent Siege: How AI is Redefining Cyber Warfare and Global Security Mar 11, 2024 Project Maven: The AI Revolution Transforming Modern Warfare Mar 9, 2024 AI Unleashed: Revolutionizing Cyber Defense with Automated Threat Neutralization Mar 8, 2024 Project Nimbus Exposed: The Ethical Storm Cloud in AI Warfare and Big Tech's Complicity Mar 7, 2024 AI at the Ballot Box: Predicting the Unpredictable in the UK's 2024 Elections Mar 7, 2024 The Lethal Autonomy: Gaza's Tragedy and the Haunting Reality of AI in Warfare Mar 7, 2024 No more next content See all Others also viewed AI is Changing Religious Practices: Exploring the Benefits and Challenges Dr.Khalid al☁☁ 1y How AI (Artificial intelligence) is affecting Spiritualism VIJAYE BEEHARRY 2y The Intersection of AI and Spirituality: Exploring the Possibility of AI Interpreting the Spiritual Realm Dr Duncan Borg Ellul 6mo Storytelling Techniques for Engaging Digital Marketing Campaigns Kiran Pandit 8mo The Power of Visual Storytelling: How Cosmetics Websites Can Engage and Inspire through Design Codevelop us 8mo TikTok's Algorithm: Decoding Personalized Content Assistiv.ai 7mo Explore topics Sales Marketing Business Administration HR Management Content Management Engineering Soft Skills See All LinkedIn © 2024 About Accessibility User Agreement Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Copyright Policy Brand Policy Guest Controls Community Guidelines العربية (Arabic) Čeština (Czech) Dansk (Danish) Deutsch (German) English (English) Español (Spanish) Français (French) हिंदी (Hindi) Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian) Italiano (Italian) 日本語 (Japanese) 한국어 (Korean) Bahasa Malaysia (Malay) Nederlands (Dutch) Norsk (Norwegian) Polski (Polish) Português (Portuguese) Română (Romanian) Русский (Russian) Svenska (Swedish) ภาษาไทย (Thai) Tagalog (Tagalog) Türkçe (Turkish) Українська (Ukrainian) 简体中文 (Chinese (Simplified)) 正體中文 (Chinese (Traditional)) Language
