Likewise, AI has spread its roots far and wide in the world of business. According to the 2022 Data and AI Leadership Executive Survey, 91% of companies today want to tap into the power of AI. While the thought of AI paints a picture of an intense sci-fi movie scene in our minds, AI is ultimately just a tool. Like any technology, AI can be used for good or bad reasons. As AI systems take on more complex forms, it is more important than ever for organizations to take an ethical approach to its usage. Giovanni Gallo | Ethico What Ethical Dilemmas in AI Exist? Aside from expanding the scope of a business’s success, AI also comes with several ethical dilemmas that must be addressed immediately. These include: Bias and Fairness. Although AI has the potential to perform seemingly complex tasks with ease, let’s not forget it is designed by humans. The most common source of AI bias often comes from the data we feed into it. Georgia Tech recently conducted research into object detection in self-driving cars. The results revealed that pedestrians with dark skin were hit about 5% more by self-driving cars than those with light skin. Why? Because the data used to train the AI included about 3.5 times more examples of light-skinned people, allowing AI to recognize that skin color better. Biases in AI will exist as long as humans do. They not only create an atmosphere of unfairness in the way the businesses operate but also come with legal and financial implications of non-compliance. Businesses must invest time and effort to ensure the data fed into AI systems remains free of biases. Transparency. AI transparency is largely concerned with the data used to train AI; the set of practices and tools deployed to understand the AI model; the type and number of errors and biases in the training system; and the methods of communicating these issues with users and developers. As AI models become more evolved and powerful, their inner workings begin to get more mysterious. As the new models become harder to understand, the inner mechanisms get buried in what is called a “black box.” Without transparency, businesses can find it challenging to detect biases or privacy concerns surrounding their AI models. This is why AI transparency has arisen as its own field, and why highly regulated industries that use AI must also develop their own AI transparency skills, policies, and procedures. Accountability. Once developed, AI models are capable of making decisions on their own. This, in turn, raises questions of accountability. Case in point: when an AI system generates an erroneous outcome or begins to have the potential to cause harm, it becomes paramount to determine who is responsible. This dilemma becomes stronger when AI systems fail to offer absolute transparency in the way they work. Businesses investing in AI models must first ensure that their decision-making processes and AI algorithms come with the highest degree of transparency. Transparency can open up access to valuable human oversight. This, in turn, can cultivate trust in the system and ensure maximum accountability. Privacy and Data Security. One of the most pressing issues surrounding AI lies in privacy and data security. Privacy is a fundamental human right and AI models (unfortunately) come with the potential to threaten it. From surveillance cameras to smartphones to the internet, technology has made it endlessly easier to accumulate personal data. The goal of this data is to help brands create personalized experiences for their customers, as consumers are more likely to buy from brands that offer personalized experiences. But what happens when companies gather this data and fail to disclose how it’s collected and stored? When companies (whether knowingly or unknowingly) monitor users without their explicit consent, they run the risk of entering unethical AI territory. A lack of solid data sanitization protocols can also raise the potential of having the data processed and sold to third parties who can then use it for unintended purposes. Those same third-parties are just as vulnerable to data breaches and cyber-attacks as the organization from whom they procured the personal data in question—if not more so. The risk of this personal data falling further into the wrong hands cannot be overstated. Before deploying any AI model, businesses must put adequate ethical controls in place and comply with ethical privacy regulations surrounding AI. Hiring and Onboarding. Deploying AI during onboarding and training opens many doors for biases and unfairness. Take Amazon’s flawed AI screening framework, for instance. The AI software Amazon created to screen job candidates ended up favoring male candidates because the data used by their AI tech included their hiring patterns from the previous decade (when the tech industry was majorly dominated by men). Due to a lack of human touch, AI may also end up disregarding the worthiest candidates. Or, it may shortlist candidates who it “thinks” meet the company’s criteria even though they’re not suited for the position. Biased and discriminatory AI systems can negatively impact a business’s compliance efforts and result in heavy losses. Before deploying an AI hiring and onboarding system, businesses must ensure it runs fairly, accurately, and ethically. Regulatory Compliance. When not analyzed and tackled with care, biases, data breaches, privacy concerns, and dilemmas surrounding AI can result in serious instances of noncompliance. This can cause businesses to suffer heavy legal, financial, and reputational losses. As AI digs its roots deeper into the world of business, several new laws and regulations will begin to break onto the shore. This will require businesses to become more fluent in their compliance language and adhere to complex (and yet to be explored) compliance requirements. mountain of challenges AI brings, business leaders may be left wondering, “What’s the best way to mitigate risks each time my organization implements a new AI solution?” Here are a few best practices leaders can implement for ethical AI use in business: Control AI Biases. To glean the ethical benefits of AI and mitigate biases, leaders must take a human-first approach. Countless biases control the results AI churns out. For instance, the software programmer demographic in the U.S. is approximately 62% white and 64% male. Businesses that don’t prioritize inclusivity and diversity often lose out on valuable ideas that can help pave a faster and more solid route to success. Start with ensuring the data fed to your AI systems is not biased. Next, make the data more inclusive. Understand that people who create AI algorithms have the power to shape the way society works—in a positive or negative light. By making your hiring processes more inclusive, you can ensure your team prioritizes diversity over bias and ethics over easy profits. Prioritize Transparency and Security in AI Use. Although your customers would prefer a personalized experience, they will not want to stay in the dark about what you do with their data. Educate your users about the way you store and use their data and how it can benefit them. By being transparent, you not only commit to ethics in business but also build trust with your customers. Being transparent with your AI use can replace restrictive regulation with a positive customer sentiment. Remember, transparency breeds trust. It creates loyal customers and equally loyal employees. If you use AI frameworks to hire, onboard, and train your employees, let them know your process works to build a long-term, trust-based relationship with them. Deploy AI Training Programs. Your business’s AI training shouldn’t just be limited to its technical borders. Make sure you take the legal, ethical, and societal impact your AI framework may have into account. Help your software developers understand that they aren’t just acting on their individual values. Instead, they have a role to play in terms of impacting the broader society positively. Today, AI has crossed the realms of creating basic product lines with minimal social implications. Instead, it comes with the power to distort the way we think. As a leader, it’s your responsibility to ensure this power is used for the greater good. Craft Policies and Procedures Surrounding AI. To ensure your business deploys AI in an ethical manner, establish a solid foundation with policies, procedures, and a code of conduct for ethical AI. Aside from developing comprehensive policies, offer the right training to ensure your workforce always puts ethics first. To boost sensitivity toward the entire spectrum of ethical issues surrounding AI, make sure you build diverse teams. Finally, check in regularly to ensure procedures are followed and objectives are achieved. Build Trust in AI Systems. Your organization’s HR, communications, marketing, and customer service departments must learn to educate users about the ethical use of AI systems. This can help build their trust in your AI framework and empower them to have more control over it. To strengthen this trust further, leaders must also encourage proactive communication surrounding AI issues—both internally and externally. Over to You! AI is deeply embedded into our everyday life. It is a valuable part of almost all business operations. Although, of course, AI comes with the potential to cause harm, a growing number of businesses have ethical mechanisms in place to prevent malicious use of AI. As long as businesses follow the best practices for ethical AI use, this technology can bring oceans of benefits to businesses of all shapes and sizes. Leaders must pay special attention to who creates AI models for their organizations to ensure an ethics-first approach. They must also constantly question how AI could impact their employees, their customers, and the world at large.

However, as AI capabilities continue to advance, so too do the ethical considerations surrounding its development and application. In this blog, we delve into the ethical dilemmas presented by AI, exploring the complex intersection of technology and morality. Join us as we navigate the intricacies of AI ethics and discuss the importance of responsible AI development and deployment.AI and Bias: One of the primary ethical concerns with AI revolves around bias. AI systems are trained on vast amounts of data, and if that data is biased, the resulting algorithms can perpetuate or even amplify societal biases. This can lead to unfair and discriminatory outcomes, impacting areas such as hiring practices, loan approvals, and criminal justice. Recognizing and addressing bias in AI is crucial to ensuring fairness and equal opportunities for all.Privacy and Data Protection: AI thrives on data, and the collection and analysis of personal information raise significant privacy concerns. As AI systems become more integrated into our lives, there is a need for robust data protection regulations and practices to safeguard individuals' privacy. Striking the right balance between data utilization for AI advancements and respecting individuals' privacy rights is a critical ethical challenge that requires ongoing attention.AI and Employment Disruption: The rise of AI automation raises concerns about the potential displacement of human workers. As AI takes over routine tasks and jobs, there is a need to address the ethical implications of widespread unemployment and the socioeconomic impact on affected communities. Developing strategies for reskilling and upskilling workers, as well as ensuring equitable distribution of the benefits of AI, are crucial steps in navigating the complex relationship between AI and employment.AI and Accountability: AI systems can make decisions and take actions autonomously, which raises questions of accountability. When an AI system produces an erroneous outcome or causes harm, it becomes essential to determine who is responsible. Establishing clear lines of accountability and liability for AI decision-making is a significant ethical consideration. Additionally, transparency in AI algorithms and decision-making processes is vital to ensure trust and enable meaningful human oversight.Ensuring AI Safety: As AI becomes more sophisticated, ensuring its safety and preventing unintended consequences becomes paramount. The potential risks of AI, such as autonomous weapons or malicious use of AI-generated content, require careful ethical consideration and regulation. Implementing frameworks for testing, verification, and ongoing monitoring of AI systems can help mitigate risks and ensure that AI is developed and utilized for the benefit of humanity.Ethics and AI are intertwined in a complex dance, requiring constant vigilance, collaboration, and critical thinking. As AI continues to permeate our society, it is crucial to address the ethical dilemmas it presents. By prioritizing fairness, privacy, accountability, and safety, we can shape the development and deployment of AI in a responsible and human-centric manner. Striking the right balance between technological advancement and moral considerations is key to harnessing the full potential of AI for the betterment of our global community.TalentServe#talentserve #AIethics#ResponsibleAI#EthicalAI#AIaccountability#FutureofTech Like Comment Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Share 13 To view or add a comment, sign in More articles by this author No more previous content GANs are the future?

This is not just an academic or a societal concern but a reputational risk for companies, no company wants to be marred with data or AI ethics scandals that impact companies like Amazon. For example, there was significant backlash due to the sale of Rekognition to law enforcement. This was followed by Amazon’s decision to stop providing this technology to law enforcement for a year since they anticipated the proper legal framework to be in place by then.This article provides insights on ethical issues that arise with the use of AI, examples from misuses of AI, and best practices to build a responsible AI.What are the ethical dilemmas of artificial intelligence?Automated decisions / AI biasAl algorithms and training data may contain biases as humans do since those are also generated by humans. These biases prevent AI systems from making fair decisions. We encounter biases in AI systems due to two reasons Developers may program biased AI systems without even noticing Historical data that will train AI algorithms may not be enough to represent the whole population fairly. Biased AI algorithms may lead to discrimination of minority groups. For instance, Amazon shut down its AI recruiting tool after using it for one year.1 Developers in Amazon state that the tool was penalizing women. About 60% of the candidates the AI tool chose were male, which was due to patterns in data on Amazon’s historical recruitments.To build an ethical & responsible AI, getting rid of biases in AI systems is necessary. Yet, only 47% of organizations test for bias in data, models, and human use of algorithms.2 Though getting rid of all biases in AI systems is almost impossible due to the existing numerous human biases and ongoing identification of new biases, minimizing them can be a business’s goal. If you want to learn more, feel free to check our comprehensive guide on AI biases and how to minimize them using best practices and tools. Also, a data-centric approach to AI development can help address bias in AI systems.Autonomous thingsAutonomous Things (AuT) are devices and machines that work on specific tasks autonomously without human interaction. These machines include self-driving cars, drones, and robotics. Since robot ethics is a broad topic, we focus on unethical issues that arise due to the use of self-driving vehicles and drones.Self-driving carsThe autonomous vehicles market was valued at $54 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach $557 billion by 2026.3 However, autonomous vehicles pose various risks to AI ethics guidelines. People and governments still question the liability and accountability of autonomous vehicles.For example, in 2018, an Uber self-driving car hit a pedestrian who later died at a hospital.4 The accident was recorded as the first death involving a self-driving car. After the investigation by the Arizona Police Department and the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), prosecutors have decided that the company is not criminally liable for the pedestrian’s death. This is because the safety driver was distracted with her cell phone, and police reports label the accident as “completely avoidable.” Lethal Autonomous Weapons (LAWs)LAWs are one of the weapons in the artificial intelligence arms race. LAWs independently identify and engage targets based on programmed constraints and descriptions. There have been debates on the ethics of using weaponized AI in the military. For example, in 2018, the United Nations gathered to discuss the issue. Specifically, countries that favor LAWs have been vocal on the issue. (Including South Korea, Russia, and America.)Counterarguments for the usage of LAWs are widely shared by non-governmental communities. For instance, a community called Campaign to Stop Killer Robots wrote a letter to warn about the threat of an artificial intelligence arms race. Some renowned faces such as Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, Noam Chomsky, Jaan Tallinn, and Demis Hassabis also signed the letter.Unemployment and income inequality due to automationThis is currently the greatest fear against AI. According to a CNBC survey, 27% of US citizens believe that AI will eliminate their jobs within five years.5 The percentage increases to 37% for citizens whose age is between 18-24. Though these numbers may not look huge for “the greatest AI fear”, don’t forget that this is just a prediction for the upcoming five years. According to Mckinsey estimates, intelligent agents and robots could replace as much as 30% of the world’s current human labor by 2030. Depending upon various adoption scenarios, automation will displace between 400 and 800 million jobs, requiring as many as 375 million people to entirely switch job categories.Comparing society’s 5-year expectations and McKinsey’s forecast for 10 years shows that people’s expectations of unemployment are more pronounced than industry experts’ estimates. However, both point to a significant share of the population being unemployed due to advances in AI.Another concern about the impacts of AI-driven automation is rising income inequality. A study found that automation has reduced or degraded the wages of US workers specialized in routine tasks by 50% to 70% since 1980.Misuses of AISurveillance practices limiting privacy“Big Brother is watching you.” This was a quote from George Orwell’s dystopian social science fiction novel called 1984. Though it was written as science fiction, it may have become a reality as governments deploy AI for mass surveillance. Implementation of facial recognition technology into surveillance systems concerns privacy rights. According to AI Global Surveillance (AIGS) Index, 176 countries are using AI surveillance systems and liberal democracies are major users of AI surveillance.6 The same study shows that 51% of advanced democracies deploy AI surveillance systems compared to 37% of closed autocratic states. However, this is likely due to the wealth gap between these 2 groups of countries. From an ethical perspective, the important question is whether governments are abusing the technology or using it lawfully. “Orwellian” surveillance methods are against human rights.Some tech giants also state ethical concerns about AI-powered surveillance. For example, Microsoft President Brad Smith published a blog post calling for government regulation of facial recognition.7 Also, IBM stopped offering the technology for mass surveillance due to its potential for misuse, such as racial profiling, which violates fundamental human rights.8 Manipulation of human judgmentAI-powered analytics can provide actionable insights into human behavior, yet, abusing analytics to manipulate human decisions is ethically wrong. The best-known example of misuse of analytics is the data scandal by Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.9 Cambridge Analytica sold American voters’ data crawled on Facebook to political campaigns and provided assistance and analytics to the 2016 presidential campaigns of Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. Information about the data breach was disclosed in 2018, and the Federal Trade Commission fined Facebook $5 billion due to its privacy violations.10 Proliferation of deepfakesDeepfakes are synthetically generated images or videos in which a person in a media is replaced with someone else’s likeness. Though about 96 % of deepfakes are pornographic videos with over 134 million views on the top four deepfake pornographic websites, the real danger and ethical concerns of society about deepfakes are how they can be used to misrepresent political leaders’ speeches.11 Creating a false narrative using deepfakes can harm people’s trust in the media (which is already at an all time low).12 This mistrust is dangerous for societies considering mass media is still the number one option of governments to inform people about emergency events (e.g., pandemic). Artificial general intelligence (AGI) / SingularityA machine capable of human-level understanding could be a threat to humanity and such research may need to be regulated. Although most AI experts don’t expect a singularity (AGI) any time soon (before 2060), as AI capabilities increase, this is an important topic from an ethical perspective.When people talk about AI, they mostly mean narrow AI systems, also referred to as weak AI, which is specified to handle a singular or limited task. On the other hand, AGI is the form of artificial intelligence that we see in science fiction books and movies. AGI means machines can understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. Robot ethicsRobot ethics, also referred to as roboethics, includes how humans design, build, use, and treat robots. There have been debates on roboethics since the early 1940s. And arguments mostly originate in the question of whether robots have rights like humans and animals do. These questions have gained increased importance with increased AI capabilities and now institutes like AI Now focus on exploring these questions with academic rigor.Author Isaac Asimov is the first one who talk about laws for robots in his short story called “Runaround”. He introduced Three Laws of Robotics13: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. A robot must obey the orders given by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. A robot must protect its existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. Generative AI-specific ethical concernsThe ethics of generative AI is relatively new and has gained attention with the release of various generative models, particularly ChatGPT by OpenAI. ChatGPT quickly gained popularity due to its ability to create authentic content on a wide range of subjects. With that, it also brought some genuine ethical concerns as well.Truthfulness & AccuracyGenerative AI employs machine learning techniques to generate new information, which may result in inaccuracies (see Figure 1). Additionally, pre-trained language models like ChatGPT cannot update and adapt to new information.Recently, language models have become more skilled in their ability to speak persuasively and eloquently. However, this advanced proficiency has also brought the potential to spread false information or even create false statements.Figure 1. On average, most generative models are truthful only 25% of the time, according to the TruthfulQA benchmark test.Source14: Stanford University Artificial Intelligence Index Report 2022Copyright ambiguitiesAnother ethical consideration with generative AI is the uncertainty surrounding the authorship and copyright of content created by the AI. This raises questions about who holds the rights to such works and how they can be utilized. The issue of copyright centers around three main questions: Are works created by AI should be eligible for copyright protection? Who would have the ownership rights over the created content? Can copyrighted-generated data be used for training purposes? For a detailed discussion on this concern, you can check our article on the copyright concerns around generative AI.Misuse of generative AI Education: Generative AI has the potential to be misused by creating false or inaccurate information that is presented as true. This could result in students receiving incorrect information or being misled. Also, students can use generative AI tools like ChatGPT to prepare their homework on a wide range of subjects. How to navigate these dilemmas?These are hard questions and innovative and controversial solutions like the universal basic income may be necessary to solve them. There are numerous initiatives and organizations aimed at minimizing the potential negative impact of AI. For instance, the Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence (IEAI) at the Technical University of Munich conducts AI research across various domains such as mobility, employment, healthcare, and sustainability. Some best practices to navigate these ethical dilemmas are:TransparencyAI developers have an ethical obligation to be transparent in a structured, accessible way since AI technology has the potential to break laws and negatively impact the human experience. To make AI accessible and transparent, knowledge sharing can help. Some initiatives are: AI research even if it takes place in private, for-profit companies, tends to be publicly shared OpenAI is a non-profit AI research company created by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and others to develop open-source AI beneficial to humanity. However, by selling one of its exclusive models to Microsoft rather than releasing the source code, OpenAI has reduced its level of transparency. Google developed TensorFlow, a widely used open-source machine learning library, to facilitate the adoption of AI. AI researchers Ben Goertzel and David Hart, created OpenCog as an open-source framework for AI development Google (and other tech giants) has an AI-specific blog that enables them to spread its AI knowledge to the world. ExplainabilityAI developers and businesses need to explain how their algorithms arrive at their predictions to overcome ethical issues that arise with inaccurate predictions. Various technical approaches can explain how these algorithms reach these conclusions and what factors affect the decision. We’ve covered explainable AI before, feel free to check it out.InclusivenessAI research tends to be done by male researchers in wealthy countries. This contributes to the biases in AI models. The increasing diversity of the AI community is key to improving model quality and reducing bias. There are numerous initiatives like this one supported by Harvard to increase diversity within the community but their impact has so far been limited.This can help solve problems such as unemployment and discrimination which can be caused by automated decision-making systems. AlignmentNumerous countries, companies, and universities are building AI systems and in most areas, there is no legal framework adapted to the recent developments in AI. Modernizing legal frameworks at both country and higher levels (e.g. UN) will clarify the path to ethical AI development. Pioneering companies should spearhead these efforts to create clarity for their industry. AI ethics frameworksAcademics are also working on frameworks to achieve ethical AI at enterprises. An example is the hourglass model presented below which outlines how organizations, AI systems, and the environment interact.15 It also comes with an extensive task list for those looking for a structured approach to AI ethics.16 Figure: AI ethics frameworksIf you are looking for AI vendors, check our data-driven lists of: AI Platforms AI Consultants AI Development Services And if you need an expert opinion on vendors and products, feel free to contact us:Find the Right Vendors External Links1. “Amazon scrapped ‘sexist AI’ tool.” BBC, 10 October 2018.

For decades, artificial intelligence, or AI, was the engine of high-level STEM research. Most consumers became aware of the technology’s power and potential through internet platforms like Google and Facebook, and retailer Amazon. Today, AI is essential across a vast array of industries, including health care, banking, retail, and manufacturing. Also in the series Science & Tech Trailblazing initiative marries ethics, tech long read Health AI revolution in medicine long read Science & Tech Imagine a world in which AI is in your home, at work, everywhere 9 min read But its game-changing promise to do things like improve efficiency, bring down costs, and accelerate research and development has been tempered of late with worries that these complex, opaque systems may do more societal harm than economic good. With virtually no U.S. government oversight, private companies use AI software to make determinations about health and medicine, employment, creditworthiness, and even criminal justice without having to answer for how they’re ensuring that programs aren’t encoded, consciously or unconsciously, with structural biases. Its growing appeal and utility are undeniable. Worldwide business spending on AI is expected to hit $50 billion this year and $110 billion annually by 2024, even after the global economic slump caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a forecast released in August by technology research firm IDC. Retail and banking industries spent the most this year, at more than $5 billion each. The company expects the media industry and federal and central governments will invest most heavily between 2018 and 2023 and predicts that AI will be “the disrupting influence changing entire industries over the next decade.” “Virtually every big company now has multiple AI systems and counts the deployment of AI as integral to their strategy,” said Joseph Fuller, professor of management practice at Harvard Business School, who co-leads Managing the Future of Work, a research project that studies, in part, the development and implementation of AI, including machine learning, robotics, sensors, and industrial automation, in business and the work world. Early on, it was popularly assumed that the future of AI would involve the automation of simple repetitive tasks requiring low-level decision-making. But AI has rapidly grown in sophistication, owing to more powerful computers and the compilation of huge data sets. One branch, machine learning, notable for its ability to sort and analyze massive amounts of data and to learn over time, has transformed countless fields, including education. Firms now use AI to manage sourcing of materials and products from suppliers and to integrate vast troves of information to aid in strategic decision-making, and because of its capacity to process data so quickly, AI tools are helping to minimize time in the pricey trial-and-error of product development — a critical advance for an industry like pharmaceuticals, where it costs $1 billion to bring a new pill to market, Fuller said. Health care experts see many possible uses for AI, including with billing and processing necessary paperwork. And medical professionals expect that the biggest, most immediate impact will be in analysis of data, imaging, and diagnosis. Imagine, they say, having the ability to bring all of the medical knowledge available on a disease to any given treatment decision. In employment, AI software culls and processes resumes and analyzes job interviewees’ voice and facial expressions in hiring and driving the growth of what’s known as “hybrid” jobs. Rather than replacing employees, AI takes on important technical tasks of their work, like routing for package delivery trucks, which potentially frees workers to focus on other responsibilities, making them more productive and therefore more valuable to employers. “It’s allowing them to do more stuff better, or to make fewer errors, or to capture their expertise and disseminate it more effectively in the organization,” said Fuller, who has studied the effects and attitudes of workers who have lost or are likeliest to lose their jobs to AI. “Can smart machines outthink us, or are certain elements of human judgment indispensable in deciding some of the most important things in life?” — Michael Sandel, political philosopher and Anne T. and Robert M. Bass Professor of Government Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard file photo Though automation is here to stay, the elimination of entire job categories, like highway toll-takers who were replaced by sensors because of AI’s proliferation, is not likely, according to Fuller. “What we’re going to see is jobs that require human interaction, empathy, that require applying judgment to what the machine is creating [will] have robustness,” he said. While big business already has a huge head start, small businesses could also potentially be transformed by AI, says Karen Mills ’75, M.B.A. ’77, who ran the U.S. Small Business Administration from 2009 to 2013. With half the country employed by small businesses before the COVID-19 pandemic, that could have major implications for the national economy over the long haul. Rather than hamper small businesses, the technology could give their owners detailed new insights into sales trends, cash flow, ordering, and other important financial information in real time so they can better understand how the business is doing and where problem areas might loom without having to hire anyone, become a financial expert, or spend hours laboring over the books every week, Mills said. One area where AI could “completely change the game” is lending, where access to capital is difficult in part because banks often struggle to get an accurate picture of a small business’s viability and creditworthiness. “It’s much harder to look inside a business operation and know what’s going on” than it is to assess an individual, she said. Information opacity makes the lending process laborious and expensive for both would-be borrowers and lenders, and applications are designed to analyze larger companies or those who’ve already borrowed, a built-in disadvantage for certain types of businesses and for historically underserved borrowers, like women and minority business owners, said Mills, a senior fellow at HBS. But with AI-powered software pulling information from a business’s bank account, taxes, and online bookkeeping records and comparing it with data from thousands of similar businesses, even small community banks will be able to make informed assessments in minutes, without the agony of paperwork and delays, and, like blind auditions for musicians, without fear that any inequity crept into the decision-making. “All of that goes away,” she said. A veneer of objectivity Not everyone sees blue skies on the horizon, however. Many worry whether the coming age of AI will bring new, faster, and frictionless ways to discriminate and divide at scale. “Part of the appeal of algorithmic decision-making is that it seems to offer an objective way of overcoming human subjectivity, bias, and prejudice,” said political philosopher Michael Sandel, Anne T. and Robert M. Bass Professor of Government. “But we are discovering that many of the algorithms that decide who should get parole, for example, or who should be presented with employment opportunities or housing … replicate and embed the biases that already exist in our society.” “If we’re not thoughtful and careful, we’re going to end up with redlining again.” — Karen Mills, senior fellow at the Business School and head of the U.S. Small Business Administration from 2009 to 2013 Jon Chase/Harvard file photo AI presents three major areas of ethical concern for society: privacy and surveillance, bias and discrimination, and perhaps the deepest, most difficult philosophical question of the era, the role of human judgment, said Sandel, who teaches a course in the moral, social, and political implications of new technologies. “Debates about privacy safeguards and about how to overcome bias in algorithmic decision-making in sentencing, parole, and employment practices are by now familiar,” said Sandel, referring to conscious and unconscious prejudices of program developers and those built into datasets used to train the software. “But we’ve not yet wrapped our minds around the hardest question: Can smart machines outthink us, or are certain elements of human judgment indispensable in deciding some of the most important things in life?” Panic over AI suddenly injecting bias into everyday life en masse is overstated, says Fuller. First, the business world and the workplace, rife with human decision-making, have always been riddled with “all sorts” of biases that prevent people from making deals or landing contracts and jobs. When calibrated carefully and deployed thoughtfully, resume-screening software allows a wider pool of applicants to be considered than could be done otherwise, and should minimize the potential for favoritism that comes with human gatekeepers, Fuller said. Sandel disagrees. “AI not only replicates human biases, it confers on these biases a kind of scientific credibility. It makes it seem that these predictions and judgments have an objective status,” he said. In the world of lending, algorithm-driven decisions do have a potential “dark side,” Mills said. As machines learn from data sets they’re fed, chances are “pretty high” they may replicate many of the banking industry’s past failings that resulted in systematic disparate treatment of African Americans and other marginalized consumers. “If we’re not thoughtful and careful, we’re going to end up with redlining again,” she said. A highly regulated industry, banks are legally on the hook if the algorithms they use to evaluate loan applications end up inappropriately discriminating against classes of consumers, so those “at the top levels” in the field are “very focused” right now on this issue, said Mills, who closely studies the rapid changes in financial technology, or “fintech.” “They really don’t want to discriminate. They want to get access to capital to the most creditworthy borrowers,” she said. “That’s good business for them, too.” Oversight overwhelmed Given its power and expected ubiquity, some argue that the use of AI should be tightly regulated. But there’s little consensus on how that should be done and who should make the rules. Thus far, companies that develop or use AI systems largely self-police, relying on existing laws and market forces, like negative reactions from consumers and shareholders or the demands of highly-prized AI technical talent to keep them in line. “There’s no businessperson on the planet at an enterprise of any size that isn’t concerned about this and trying to reflect on what’s going to be politically, legally, regulatorily, [or] ethically acceptable,” said Fuller. Firms already consider their own potential liability from misuse before a product launch, but it’s not realistic to expect companies to anticipate and prevent every possible unintended consequence of their product, he said. Few think the federal government is up to the job, or will ever be. “The regulatory bodies are not equipped with the expertise in artificial intelligence to engage in [oversight] without some real focus and investment,” said Fuller, noting the rapid rate of technological change means even the most informed legislators can’t keep pace. Requiring every new product using AI to be prescreened for potential social harms is not only impractical, but would create a huge drag on innovation. “I wouldn’t have a central AI group that has a division that does cars, I would have the car people have a division of people who are really good at AI.” — Jason Furman, a professor of the practice of economic policy at the Kennedy School and a former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama Rose Lincoln/Harvard Staff Photographer Jason Furman, a professor of the practice of economic policy at Harvard Kennedy School, agrees that government regulators need “a much better technical understanding of artificial intelligence to do that job well,” but says they could do it. Existing bodies like the National Highway Transportation Safety Association, which oversees vehicle safety, for example, could handle potential AI issues in autonomous vehicles rather than a single watchdog agency, he said. “I wouldn’t have a central AI group that has a division that does cars, I would have the car people have a division of people who are really good at AI,” said Furman, a former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama. Though keeping AI regulation within industries does leave open the possibility of co-opted enforcement, Furman said industry-specific panels would be far more knowledgeable about the overarching technology of which AI is simply one piece, making for more thorough oversight. While the European Union already has rigorous data-privacy laws and the European Commission is considering a formal regulatory framework for ethical use of AI, the U.S. government has historically been late when it comes to tech regulation. “I think we should’ve started three decades ago, but better late than never,” said Furman, who thinks there needs to be a “greater sense of urgency” to make lawmakers act. Business leaders “can’t have it both ways,” refusing responsibility for AI’s harmful consequences while also fighting government oversight, Sandel maintains.

I think there needs to be more of both,” he said, later adding: “We can’t assume that market forces by themselves will sort it out. That’s a mistake, as we’ve seen with Facebook and other tech giants.” Last fall, Sandel taught “Tech Ethics,” a popular new Gen Ed course with Doug Melton, co-director of Harvard’s Stem Cell Institute. As in his legendary “Justice” course, students consider and debate the big questions about new technologies, everything from gene editing and robots to privacy and surveillance. “Companies have to think seriously about the ethical dimensions of what they’re doing and we, as democratic citizens, have to educate ourselves about tech and its social and ethical implications — not only to decide what the regulations should be, but also to decide what role we want big tech and social media to play in our lives,” said Sandel. Doing that will require a major educational intervention, both at Harvard and in higher education more broadly, he said. “We have to enable all students to learn enough about tech and about the ethical implications of new technologies so that when they are running companies or when they are acting as democratic citizens, they will be able to ensure that technology serves human purposes rather than undermines a decent civic life.” Next: The AI revolution in medicine may lift personalized treatment, fill gaps in access to care, and cut red tape. Yet risks abound.

Tip Generative AI ethics: 8 biggest concerns and risks Under the radar for decades, generative AI is upending business models and forcing ethical issues like customer privacy, brand integrity and worker displacement to the forefront. Share this item with your network: By George Lawton Published: 01 Nov 2023 Like other forms of AI, generative AI can influence a number of ethical issues and risks surrounding data privacy, security, policies and workforces. Generative AI technology can also potentially produce a series of new business risks like misinformation, plagiarism, copyright infringements and harmful content. Lack of transparency and the potential for worker displacement are additional issues that enterprises may need to address. "Many of the risks posed by generative AI … are enhanced and more concerning than others," said Tad Roselund, managing director and senior partner at consultancy BCG. Those risks require a comprehensive approach, including a clearly defined strategy, good governance and a commitment to responsible AI. A corporate culture that embraces generative AI ethics must consider eight important issues. 1. Distribution of harmful content AI systems can create content automatically based on text prompts by humans. "These systems can generate enormous productivity improvements, but they can also be used for harm, either intentional or unintentional," explained Bret Greenstein, partner, cloud and digital analytics insights, at professional services consultancy PwC. An AI-generated email sent on behalf of the company, for example, could inadvertently contain offensive language or issue harmful guidance to employees. Generative AI should be used to augment, not replace humans or processes, Greenstein advised, to ensure content meets the company's ethical expectations and supports its brand values. 2. Copyright and legal exposure Popular generative AI tools are trained on massive image and text databases from multiple sources, including the internet. When these tools create images or generate lines of code, the data's source could be unknown, which can be problematic for a bank handling financial transactions or pharmaceutical company relying on a formula for a complex molecule in a drug. Reputational and financial risks could also be massive if one company's product is based on another company's intellectual property. "Companies must look to validate outputs from the models," Roselund advised, "until legal precedents provide clarity around IP and copyright challenges." This article is part of What is generative AI? Everything you need to know Which also includes: 8 top generative AI tool categories for 2024 Will AI replace jobs? 9 job types that might be affected 16 of the best large language models Businesses are scrambling to maximize the benefits of today's generative AI while wrestling with inherent ethical issues. 3. Data privacy violations Generative AI large language models (LLMs) are trained on data sets that sometimes include personally identifiable information (PII) about individuals. This data can sometimes be elicited with a simple text prompt, noted Abhishek Gupta, founder and principal researcher at the Montreal AI Ethics Institute. And compared to traditional search engines, it can be more difficult for a consumer to locate and request removal of the information. Companies that build or fine-tune LLMs must ensure that PII isn't embedded in the language models and that it's easy to remove PII from these models in compliance with privacy laws. 4. Sensitive information disclosure Generative AI is democratizing AI capabilities and making them more accessible. This combination of democratization and accessibility, Roselund said, could potentially lead to a medical researcher inadvertently disclosing sensitive patient information or a consumer brand unwittingly exposing its product strategy to a third party. The consequences of unintended incidents like these could irrevocably breach patient or customer trust and carry legal ramifications. Roselund recommended that companies institute clear guidelines, governance and effective communication from the top down, emphasizing shared responsibility for safeguarding sensitive information, protected data and IP. 5. Amplification of existing bias Generative AI can potentially amplify existing biases -- for example, bias can be found in data used for training LLMs outside the control of companies that use these language models for specific applications. It's important for companies working on AI to have diverse leaders and subject matter experts to help identify unconscious bias in data and models, Greenstein said. 6. Workforce roles and morale AI can do a lot more of the daily tasks that knowledge workers do, including writing, coding, content creation, summarization and analysis, said Greenstein. Although worker displacement and replacement have been ongoing since the first AI and automation tools were deployed, the pace has accelerated as a result of the innovations in generative AI technologies. "The future of work itself is changing," Greenstein added, "and the most ethical companies are investing in this [change]." Ethical responses have included investments in preparing certain parts of the workforce for the new roles created by generative AI applications. Businesses, for example, will need to help employees develop generative AI skills such as prompt engineering. "The truly existential ethical challenge for adoption of generative AI is its impact on organizational design, work and ultimately on individual workers," said Nick Kramer, vice president of applied solutions at consultancy SSA & Company. "This will not only minimize the negative impacts, but it will also prepare the companies for growth." 7. Data provenance Generative AI systems consume tremendous volumes of data that could be inadequately governed, of questionable origin, used without consent or contain bias. Additional levels of inaccuracy can be amplified by social influencers or the AI systems themselves. "The accuracy of a generative AI system depends on the corpus of data it uses and its provenance," explained Scott Zoldi, chief analytics officer at credit scoring services company FICO. "ChatGPT-4 is mining the internet for data, and a lot of it is truly garbage, presenting a basic accuracy problem on answers to questions to which we don't know the answer." FICO, according to Zoldi, has been using generative AI for more than a decade to simulate edge cases in training fraud detection algorithms. The generated data is always labeled as synthetic data so Zoldi's team knows where the data is allowed to be used. "We treat it as walled-off data for the purposes of test and simulation only," he said. "Synthetic data produced by generative AI does not inform the model going forward in the future. We contain this generative asset and do not allow it 'out in the wild.'" 8. Lack of explainability and interpretability Many generative AI systems group facts together probabilistically, going back to the way AI has learned to associate data elements with one another, Zoldi explained. But these details aren't always revealed when using applications like ChatGPT. Consequently, data trustworthiness is called into question. When interrogating generative AI, analysts expect to arrive at a causal explanation for outcomes. But machine learning models and generative AI search for correlations, not causality. "That's where we humans need to insist on model interpretability -- the reason why the model gave the answer it did," Zoldi said. "And truly understand if an answer is a plausible explanation versus taking the outcome at face value." Until that level of trustworthiness can be achieved, generative AI systems should not be relied upon to provide answers that could significantly affect lives and livelihoods.

But how biased are these systems? Ethics become more important than ever.September 26, 2022 by Codemotion Artificial intelligence systems have become more capable over the past few years. These systems have made the world more efficient and a lot richer. With this technology, machines can think like humans and can mimic the actions of people. This has enabled high levels of automation and has helped companies save a lot of money. While AI can be extremely useful, it comes with various ethical issues. We shall explore these concerns in this guide about some of the main challenges and concepts of ethics in artificial intelligence. Current Situation of AI Development A good proportion of businesses today use artificial intelligence to run their operations. This technology has made its way into various enterprise applications, including customer relationship management and workforce productivity. Investment in this technology has grown to over $70 billion, and AI experts have become some of the most sought-after professionals in the world. Voice-based assistants are the most common forms of AI, and they are used in a wide range of industries. These industries include automotive, IT, and retail. Lots of companies also use chatbots for customer support. These bots help to improve customer satisfaction, and they save companies a lot of money as they don’t need to hire customer service assistants. Here are other popular uses of AI systems: Personalised shopping in online storesForecasts for financial servicesNetwork feeds on social media sitesSecurity systems and face detectionAnti-virus threat detectionWarehouse managementSafety in the automotive sectorThe internet of things Augmented intelligence is an emerging form of AI, and it aims at enhancing human intelligence. Edge AI is also being developed and will make it possible for AI algorithms to work locally without the need for an internet connection. For example, some forms of facial recognition are able to process data without the need for internet access. Ethical issues in technology Businesses often strive for ethics in decision-making and practices. We often look poorly at brands that don’t take ethics seriously and most people wouldn’t be happy to work with such companies. Since it is becoming a key part of our lives, it is important to consider ethics in artificial intelligence. With technology, businesses can collect and store users’ information. Whenever you browse internet sites, buy things online, and enter your information on social media sites, you are constantly providing personal data to companies. While this data is primarily meant to personalize our experiences on various sites, it can easily be misused or lost. Data has become the new gold, and many companies make money by selling their customers’ information. For businesses, it is extremely valuable to know which products are being searched for and what customers prefer. Politicians also need to know which social issues are getting the most attention. These issues have created an entire market where businesses can buy and sell customer information. While technology helps companies cut down on their staff, it can end up making certain jobs obsolete. This can make workers less confident in their job security. It is worth noting that advanced AI will be able to handle skilled jobs like accounting and blogging, so it’s not just low-level tasks that will be affected. Ethics in Artificial Intelligence Artificial intelligence offers lots of benefits to society. However, it also presents various dilemmas in ethics. These include the risk of user privacy, complexity in neutrality, and the issue of unconscious bias. Recommended video: What is Machine Learning Fairness? 1. Risks to User Privacy Companies feed a lot of data into their AI systems, and this information is susceptible to data breaches. The loss of data can lead to identity theft and other serious issues. It is also possible for artificial intelligence systems to generate personal data without the permission of individuals. Another form of AI that intrudes on user privacy is facial recognition. This form of technology can identify individuals without their consent. It involves using real-time public surveillance or aggregation of databases that are usually not legally construed. It can be used to track a person’s movement through a city where there are surveillance cameras. Facial recognition technology is considered illegal in many parts of the world as it invades people’s privacy. Health tracking is also an ethical issue in AI, and this was a major concern around the world during the Covid-19 pandemic. Overall, artificial intelligence raises the analysis of personal information to new levels, and this intrudes on personal privacy. 2. Complexity of Neutrality in Technology AI has traditionally been considered neutral technology, but this has proven to be far from reality. This technology can easily mismatch individuals because of their race or other characteristics. It is also used in granting loans and can discriminate against people because of their gender or race. For example, a man and woman with the same credit history and income may get approved for different sizes of loans purely because of their gender. Complexity in neutrality emerges because humans unknowingly transfer existing stereotypes through the data collection process. The developer may also apply their own biases when programming the systems. This is a major ethics concern as artificial intelligence is used to make decisions in many areas of our lives. It is applied in the health sector, financial sector, and other crucial industries. It can even filter out certain candidates for jobs because of this bias. 3. Unconscious Bias in Data Bias in data is becoming more and more common. Bias in artificial intelligence occurs when the results cannot be generalized widely. This issue can result from preferences or exclusions in training data, but it also emerges from how the data is obtained and how the algorithm is designed. For example, a researcher can collect data on the heights of people in a city. This information can present unconscious bias depending on the people who were surveyed or the time the data was collected. If a data set has a bias, artificial intelligence systems will learn while applying the bias. Unconscious bias can present ethical issues as it can lead to discrimination. For example, a company can use AI to improve diversity in the hiring process. However, since the system learns from the data its fed, it will end up favouring certain applicants based on demographic groups. Legal systems can also try to create more standard and fair sentencing guidelines by training AI machines, but these are still likely to give harsher sentences to people of specific groups. 4. Why do we keep replicating culture and society topics? AI systems end up replicating societal norms since they are meant to think like humans. For example, machine learning models for translation have been noted to associate male names with words like ‘salary’ or ‘professional’, while female names have been associated with terms like ‘wedding’. The algorithm is unlikely to be making the association on its own and may simply be trained on texts that reflect these gender tropes. Possible solutions Governments around the world have come up with legislation to protect customers from the misuse of their data. The European Union recently passed the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law which outlines how companies should protect customer data. Websites operating in the region have to be compliant with this law to continue selling goods and services. Bias in AI can be mitigated by using gender-neutral language when training the system. For example, instead of using the word ‘businessman’, you can use the term ‘businessperson’. This will make it harder for the system to discriminate against people based on gender. It is also necessary for companies to use diverse teams to train the AI system. Customers and users of the AI system can also offer feedback so that the developer keeps track of how it is performing. You should have a concrete plan on how to improve the model based on the feedback you receive from users. The creator of the model should also provide sufficient and quality information. facebooktwitterlinkedinredditShare on:facebooktwitterlinkedinredditTagged as:AI ethics How to Build Your Own Cloud Network Previous Post Scroll-Triggered Animations: Do’s and Don’tsNext Post Related articlesVideo: What is Machine Learning Fairness?7 Best Ways Chatbots Can Help You Generate a Better User ExperienceWorking with Date Intervals in Data Warehouses and Data LakesTake Data to the Next Level With Graph Machine LearningEverything You Need to Know on How to Test AI-Driven Systems AI in Software Testing: How They Work to Ensure Top-Quality DevelopmentPrimary SidebarAbout the authorCodemotionArticles wirtten by the Codemotion staff.

However, the ethical implications of AI decision-making have become a hot topic of discussion. One such ethical scenario is the "Trolley Problem," a thought experiment that examines the moral choices involved in AI decision-making. Let’s try to understand the Trolley Problem and explore real-world use cases that highlight the ethical challenges AI poses in these sectors.What is Trolley Problem:The Trolley Problem is a well-known thought experiment in ethics and moral philosophy. It presents a hypothetical scenario in which a person is standing near a set of railroad tracks and sees a runaway trolley (or train) approaching. There are multiple people tied up and unable to move on the tracks, and the trolley is heading straight for them. The person standing nearby has the option to pull a lever and divert the trolley onto a different track, where there is only one person tied up.The moral dilemma arises when one has to decide whether to take action and pull the lever, causing the trolley to switch tracks and potentially save the lives of many at the cost of one life, or to refrain from intervening, allowing the trolley to continue on its current path, resulting in the deaths of multiple people.Why is the Trolley Problem Relevant to AI?Nowadays AI is increasingly being integrated into decision-making processes, from automated vehicles to credit assessments and medical diagnostics. As AI systems become more complex with the use of deep learning initiatives, the potential for consequences for decisions is growing, necessitating ethical considerations to ensure responsible and accountable AI implementation. Where Does the Trolley Problem Impact AI Applications?The Trolley Problem can arise in various applications, including but not limited to:Healthcare: AI-driven medical diagnoses may raise ethical concerns when determining the allocation of limited medical resources or prioritizing certain patient populations.Finance: AI-powered credit assessments must be designed to ensure fairness and avoid discrimination against specific demographic groups.Autonomous Vehicles: Self-driving cars must make split-second decisions in potential accident scenarios, raising questions about the ethical considerations guiding their choices.How to Address the Trolley Problem in AI:Transparent Decision-Making:To tackle the ethical challenges of AI decision-making, implementing Explainable AI (XAI) is essential. XAI enables organizations to understand the factors contributing to AI-generated outcomes, promoting transparency and trust.Bias Mitigation:Regularly auditing AI algorithms for potential biases and taking proactive measures to eliminate discrimination is crucial. Ensuring diverse and inclusive datasets during AI model training can significantly reduce biased outcomes.Human-in-the-Loop Approach:Incorporating human judgment and oversight in AI decision-making can add an additional layer of ethical consideration. Having humans involved in critical decisions can mitigate the risk of unintended consequences.Conclusion: The Trolley Problem of AI challenges us to confront complex ethical decisions in the era of AI integration. As AI continues to evolve, it is imperative to address the ethical implications to build a responsible and inclusive future.Ref: https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/05/ai-s-trolley-problem-debate-can-lead-us-to-surprising-conclusions/https://hbr.org/2022/09/ai-isnt-ready-to-make-unsupervised-decisions Help improve contributions Mark contributions as unhelpful if you find them irrelevant or not valuable to the article.

It plays an important role in the lives of billions of people. Sometimes unnoticed but with visible consequences, artificial intelligence is transforming society. It calls into question the human being and human values. The development of these new technologies brings many benefits, but also challenges and risks, when they are used maliciously or to exacerbate inequalities or divides. To ensure that artificial intelligence serves the common good, it is important to ask the right questions by addressing the ethical dilemmas.WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?The term artificial intelligence was coined in the 1950s to describe machines capable of learning and performing tasks automatically. Several definitions of AI exist. However, it is commonly accepted that machines incorporating artificial intelligence can mimic or exceed human cognitive abilities such as reasoning, analysis, detection, linguistic interaction or problem solving. These intelligent machines can demonstrate learning capabilities using machine learning or deep learning algorithms to mimic the functioning of the human brain.The influence of AI is increasing and can be found in various fields such as health, scientific research, communications, transport, education, security and art. Companies using artificial intelligence to train their machines have access to a large amount of data, "big data", to collect and process. Artificial intelligence can be a powerful tool to address various environmental issues. Nevertheless, several ethical dilemmas arise and need to be discussed. It is therefore important to define international and national policies and regulatory frameworks to enable emerging technologies and AI to serve humans. Every actor in society, individuals and companies, has a role to play. TECH FOR GOOD, TECHNOLOGY FOR THE COMMON GOOD"Tech for Good" literally means "technology for good". It is an initiative launched in 2018 by French President Emmanuel Macron with the aim of ensuring that technology acts for the common good. This dynamic manifests the collective awareness that "positive societal impact" must be put back at the heart of tech and the digital transformation of society. It can also be a lever to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) created by the United Nations to make the world a better place. With the development of new technologies, including artificial intelligence, the various economic players, including those in the social economy (SSE), can see new opportunities for action. At isahit, artificial intelligence is used to develop its digital project outsourcing platform. Thus, the startup offers an innovative and responsible solution for companies looking to outsource their digital projects (annotations of images or videos to train machines in the automotive sectorThis is not only for the employees who work on the digital platform, by having financial support for the realisation of their professional projects and their integration in the world which is becoming more and more digital.Aware of the opportunities offered by artificial intelligence and digital technology as a whole, isahit is also part of Tech For Good, which ensures that the biases of AI are reduced or even absorbed. The regulation of the use of artificial intelligence is crucial. In this way, deeply rooted stereotypical representations in our societies can be abolished and lead to a more just and equitable world in the future.Related post: Isahit is present in the 1st mapping of startups with a positive impact on society, the economy and the environment.âMany questions around the development of artificial intelligence arise as these autonomous programs make more and more decisions in various fields. But can these decisions of the machines follow a particular ethics and which one? What are the 10 biggest ethical dilemmas presented by AI?Â What is an ethical dilemma?An ethical dilemma is a difficult decision making situation that demands a compromise between two options that does not really align with the existing code of ethics or societal norms.Â WHAT ARE EXAMPLES OF ETHICAL DILEMMAS?AI bias: artificial intelligence systems produce biased results. Take the example of search engines explained by UNESCO. If you do a search on "greatest historical figures" in your favourite search engine, you will probably see a list of the most famous male figures in the world and few if any women highlighted. You can also do another test by searching for images on "colours for girls". The predominant colour is pink with its different shades. There are many other examples related to the representation of women in search engines, especially in digital. These are examples of stereotypes and prejudices that are deeply rooted in society. Search engine technology is not neutral. It processes and collects complex data and then prioritises results according to users' preferences and location. To ensure fairer and more relevant results, it is crucial that gender bias is reduced or avoided in the development of AI-based algorithms, in their training and in their use. the autonomous car: this is a vehicle that is able to detect and analyse its environment and move around with little or no human intervention. In order to move safely, the car will capture thousands of pieces of data using its various sensors located in its interior. This data will then be processed by the car's autonomous driving computer system. The autonomous car must also be trained to understand its environment in order to be able to make decisions according to the different situations in which it may find itself.Everyone faces moral decisions every day. When a driver chooses to brake to avoid hitting a pedestrian, he or she is making a moral decision to pass on the risk to the pedestrian to the people in the car with them. Consider a car with damaged brakes speeding towards two individuals: a grandmother and a child. By swerving a little, one of the two people can be saved. In this situation, the car's trained algorithm will make the decision instead of the human driver. Which person should be saved? Do you think there is only one right answer in this case? The choice is difficult for the human. This is a typical dilemma that shows the importance of ethics in the development of artificial intelligence, and in technology on a larger scale. Other examples of ethical dilemmas exist with the use of artificial intelligence in the fields of art or in legal systems.To address this problem of ethical dilemmas, UNESCO has prepared a comprehensive legal document on the ethics of AI.Top ten ethical dilemmas in AIEthical dilemmas are numerous, but we will be analyzing the important ones and they are as follows:Inequality:The work force is structured in such a way that when you work you are paid your wages or salary depending on the system you are into. But with the introduction of AI, we have seen a drastic decline in the need for human labor as machines are programmed to do the work humans are supposed to do, and they make a joke of the term division of labor as they can take on the jobs of 10 persons and do it faster and more effectively. This will cause a big gap in the economy of the world as wealth will only circulated among the owners of tech companies thereby creating a high rate of wealth inequality and unemployment in the societyMistakes of Artificial intelligence:No matter how we see it, machines do not have a mind of their own as they have been programmed to work with specific instructions and guidelines. They canât make an on-site decision as they are not thinking beings. This will affect their output as they tend to make lots of mistakes, and in some instances they can be manipulated as they donât know right from wrong.Singularity:We need to ask ourselves this question, will their come a time when humans will go down the lower food chain and stop being the most intelligent species on earth? The singular reason why humans are on the top of that food chain is because of our intelligence and ingenuity. So, will there be a time when machines will have the same advantage of control and higher intelligence over us and we wonât be at the helm of affairs. All these questions are a cause for concern.Robot rights:A point has come when the rights of robots are to be discussed, everyday new milestones are achieved in trying to model robots to think and feel like humans just like animals are lesser humans. Irrespective of the fact that this has not recorded a significant success, but the rights of robots will sooner or later be a cause for concern. Could we consider that a system is suffering when it gives a negative output? At what point do we draw the line of what is to be considered as an abuse on a robot? All these are things humans need to deliberate on.Privacy and Surveillance:The use of artificial intelligence has limited peopleâs right to privacy as there are many spywares online that can be used to spy on peopleâs privacy without their consent. Governments make use of AI surveillance and facial recognitions to run their intelligence agency and this infringes on peopleâs privacy rightMisinformation/fake news:Most misinformation and fake news are peddled online. There is an online term known as âdeep fakesâ, whereby human images are cloned to look and talk like that particular individual. This deep fake was only made possible with the use of artificial intelligence and this is causing more harm than good because individuals could be falsely accused. . The bizarre thing about this âdeep fakesâ is that it looks real, so it will take an expert to know that the images or videos were cloned.Â Racist robots/ AI bias:Artificial intelligence is programmed by humans and humans have their religious, social and moral biases. This can be intentionally and unintentionally imbibed in the use of AI. AIs are programmed to do exactly what they are told, so they can be used as an instrument of hate speeches, racist commentaries, and ethnic marginalization if care is not taken.Security:In this period when countries are building nuclear weapons of mass destruction, how do we regulate what is out there. We need to invest more on cyber security and regulations that will regulate hackers, and use of weapons of mass destruction so as to save and preserve mankind. This is because the fight is against systems that are proving to be smarter, and more capable than us by orders of magnitude.Unemployment:As we enjoy the advantages that come with AI. Letâs not forget one of the major disadvantages which is creation of unemployment. As we invent ways to automate jobs, we should also invent ways to create more jobs for humans so that the economy will be balanced. Imagine what will happen when robots take over the whole workforce, what will then be the faith of humans?Â Environmental impact:The carbons that computers emit are 17 times higher than what an average human being emits in a year. In this era of creating awareness of climate change, we need to reconsider our choices. Irrespective of the fact that AI has been very effective in solving human problems, we need to set our priorities right in that aspect.Access a trained Workforce, managed ethically.Ethically scale your digital annotation projects with our highly trained workforce.
