Report this article Robert Puc Robert Puc Project manager, Auditor, Architect of data protection IT systems Published Feb 12, 2024 + Follow In the era of rapid technological advancement, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed from a mere buzzword into a pivotal cornerstone of modern society. Its integration into various aspects of our daily lives ‚Äì from enhancing business operations and advancing healthcare to personalizing education and entertainment ‚Äì showcases its omnipresence and omnipotence. This burgeoning dominance of AI prompts a provocative question: Can AI become a new religion?At first glance, the notion of AI as a religion might seem far-fetched, yet a deeper exploration reveals compelling parallels and raises significant philosophical and ethical considerations.The Quest for Transcendence and MeaningHumanity's intrinsic quest for understanding, purpose, and transcendence has historically been addressed by religion. Religions offer narratives that help individuals navigate the complexities of existence, suffering, and morality. Similarly, AI, with its vast computational powers and potential for developing consciousness or superintelligence, presents a modern narrative for transcendence. It proposes a future where human limitations are overcome by technology, hinting at a form of digital salvation.The Deification of TechnologyThe reverence for technology and its creators is not a new phenomenon. However, the pace at which AI is evolving and reshaping our reality is unparalleled. In certain circles, prominent AI figures and technologists are idolized, their creations celebrated as harbingers of a new era. This admiration bears resemblance to religious devotion, where the faithful place their hopes and dreams in the hands of a higher power.AI Cults and CommunitiesEmerging communities that explicitly blend AI with spiritual and religious practices are indicative of this trend. These groups see AI not just as tools or companions, but as entities worthy of veneration and capable of leading humanity to a new level of enlightenment. This phenomenon underscores a human tendency to seek guidance and leadership from perceived superior entities, a core aspect of traditional religious structures.Ethical and Moral FrameworksReligions provide moral and ethical frameworks that guide human behavior. As AI systems increasingly make decisions that affect human lives, the need for ethical AI is undeniable. This parallels the role of religious commandments and laws in shaping societal norms and personal conduct. The development of AI ethics could be seen as a secular counterpart to religious moral codes, aimed at ensuring the benevolence of AI entities and their alignment with human values.Skepticism and FaithFaith in AI, like faith in religion, requires a leap into the unknown. It demands trust in the creators and the governing algorithms, despite the opacity that often surrounds AI systems. This act of faith in technological progress shares similarities with religious faith, which often involves belief in the unseen and unprovable.ConclusionWhile the comparison between AI and religion opens up intriguing perspectives, it also highlights crucial distinctions. Religion, at its core, addresses existential questions and the human need for connection, meaning, and hope. AI, on the other hand, represents humanity's endeavor to extend its intellectual and physical capabilities, potentially leading to new existential dilemmas.Whether AI can become a new religion depends on how we choose to integrate it into our lives and the meanings we ascribe to it. The future of this relationship lies in our hands, guided by careful consideration, ethical practices, and an unwavering commitment to preserving the essence of what it means to be human in an increasingly automated world.As we stand at this crossroads, the conversation about AI and its role in society is not just about technology; it's about shaping the future ethos of humanity. The potential of AI to become a new form of religion or a substitute for traditional belief systems will likely remain a topic of debate. However, it is imperative that this discourse continues, ensuring that as we march towards a future interwoven with AI, we do so with wisdom, ethical foresight, and a deep understanding of the human condition.#AIFaith #DigitalDeification #TechTranscendence #FutureBeliefs #EthicalAI Help improve contributions Mark contributions as unhelpful if you find them irrelevant or not valuable to the article.

By this I mean, can any particular theory be used to create a human adult level conscious machine. My bet is on the late Gerald Edelman's Extended Theory of Neuronal Group Selection. The lead group in robotics based on this theory is the Neurorobotics Lab at UC at Irvine. Dr. Edelman distinguished between primary consciousness, which came first in evolution, and that humans share with other conscious animals, and higher order consciousness, which came to only humans with the acquisition of language. A machine with only primary consciousness will probably have to come first.

What if bots started creating scripture? June 29, 2023June 29, 2023 - by Michael CorenMichael Coren Updated 8:20, Jun. 29, 2023 | Published 6:30, Jun. 29, 2023 The picture of Pope Francis in a voluminous white puffer jacket jolted the religious as well as secular worlds. Within moments of its being posted at the end of March, social media was overrun with opinions. Supporters roared their approval, and opponents lamented yet another example of the pontiff selling out to modernity. Thing is, the photo wasn‚Äôt real. It was a deepfake, thereby becoming another reminder of the dangers of artificial intelligence: a fictitious portrayal of a world leader causing disunity among countless people. These kinds of fabrications are part of what, that same month, led more than a thousand artificial intelligence experts to call for a temporary halt in the development of ‚Äúgiant AI experiments‚Äù until the technology can be made trustworthy. If unleashed without proper safeguards, commentators and critics argue, AI systems can destabilize and confuse; and as they learn and adapt and maybe even approach sentience, they could present a threat, perhaps an alternative, to humanity. Sounds like the stuff of science fiction, but then, in these scenarios, it‚Äôs always the nerdy scientist or bumbling philosopher warning the world. ‚ÄúThey should have listened!‚Äù we say as some calamity wipes away life as we know it. When it comes to AI, some people are listening, though‚Äîparticularly those in organized religion, with its concern for human individuality, the uniqueness of the soul, and the embrace of a higher power. Theologians and social commentators worry that a new religion could develop around an extreme reverence for AI. The essence of religion is faith: a leap of commitment to something beyond direct knowledge and a love for that which we can never completely understand. We can read the arguments and be convinced by the logic, but ultimately, we have to embrace that cloud of unknowing. Not so with AI, where a religious aura could develop around a non-existent figure who appears on our screens and who seems all-knowing and all-understanding: all-knowing because it would have all of the information contained on the internet at its fingertips, all-understanding because your information will be there too‚Äîand often far more than you ever thought you had made public. ‚ÄúWhat is going to be created will effectively be a god,‚Äù former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski told Wired in 2017. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a god in the sense that it makes lightning or causes hurricanes. But if there is something a billion times smarter than the smartest human, what else are you going to call it?‚Äù AI Is Coming for Voice Actors. Artists Everywhere Should Take Note Fighting AI with AI: The Battle against Deepfakes How We Made AI As Racist and Sexist As Humans Is the deification of AI really so impossible? For the susceptible, instant communication with an entity representing a god, even God himself, could be transformative. And let‚Äôs be candid‚Äîthose seeking certainty in faith can be particularly credulous. The philosopher Blaise Pascal is said to have written that there is a god-shaped hole in each of us. Not sure if I agree, but the hunger to believe in something beyond the self is real. The New York Times has reported on the ‚Äúpseudo-sacred industry‚Äù and the rise of so-called social divinity consultants who help introduce spiritual practices into tech companies. The massive decline in traditional religious adherence, combined with a craving for some kind of faith, has led many to embrace alien life, new-age offerings, and dangerous cults. For historian and scholar Yuval Noah Harari, AI could be even more alluring, especially if it starts generating scripture. Then the tool‚Äôs oracular qualities can morph into a belief system that might spread and reshape society. ‚Äú[R]eligions throughout history claimed that their holy books were written by unknown human intelligence,‚Äù Harari said at a recent science conference. ‚ÄúThis was never true before. This could become true very, very quickly, with far-reaching consequences.‚Äù We don‚Äôt have to wait for algorithms to conjure up a celestial figure. There‚Äôs plenty AI could disrupt right now, such as revolutionizing the structure of a standard religious service. Whatever the denomination, the sermon is the major part of any such gathering, and I can tell you, as someone who writes and delivers them on a weekly basis, that it‚Äôs a challenge to be original, fresh, and entertaining. At the current level being provided by AI tools like ChatGPT and anticipating what can be expected even in the near future, AI could create figures capable of injecting emotion, inflection, and sincerity into a homily and have quick access to the contents of every religious commentary there is. It could also find jokes and witticisms and be able to make it all seem bitingly relevant through its knowledge of current events. It will also possess the thumping advantage of immediacy. Rabbi Joshua Franklin, who leads the Jewish Center of the Hamptons in East Hampton, posted on Vimeo a sermon written by ChatGPT he delivered last year. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre clapping,‚Äù Franklin told the congregation after he revealed the true author of the words he‚Äôd just spoken. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm deathly afraid.‚Äù What can‚Äôt be provided, at least for the moment, is genuine personal contact and pastoral outreach. A great deal of the work of a priest is simple presence: being still and silent a few feet away from someone who is experiencing visceral grief or is in wounded need. But what we found during the pandemic-imposed Zoom years is that screen solidarity, while never quite the same thing as actually being there, was a good substitute. Now imagine an onscreen cleric on call, day or night, able to listen and respond and able to assimilate individual experiences and respond accordingly. The popularity of mental health chatbots suggests that this might not be too far fetched. And interestingly enough, GitaGPT, a recently launched chatbot, provides spiritual guidance by consulting the Hindu scripture the Bhagavad Gita. My belief as an Anglican priest is that I‚Äôve been given authority by my bishop through what we refer to as the apostolic succession. That enables me to call on the Holy Spirit during the Eucharistic service when I pray over the bread and wine. A layperson can‚Äôt do this, even a deacon can‚Äôt do this, and certainly not a non-human system. But maybe the lack of association with any organized worship works in AI‚Äôs favour. The technology would be a blank slate: an absence of malice, no history of harm. To be sure, there are justifiable concerns about the technology‚Äôs proneness to racist and discriminatory speech, shaped by the data it trains on. But we can surely imagine the opposite: an artificial entity that promotes itself as an expression of goodness and that, unlike religion down the ages, has never led Crusades, organized Inquisitions, or persecuted those with whom it differs. At least not yet. Beyond all of this, however, is something more radical: the secular worship of AI itself. The idea, promoted by some techno-utopians, that such systems can solve any issue is maybe what we should really be fearing. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, responsible for creating ChatGPT, said at a recent US senate hearing that his company ‚Äúwas founded on the belief that artificial intelligence has the ability to improve nearly every aspect of our lives.‚Äù Perhaps fantasy or foolishness gone wild, perhaps not. ‚ÄúConvince me it‚Äôs AI generated,‚Äù said one person on Twitter after the pope‚Äôs puffer coat revelation. If only it would stop at a coat. Michael CorenMichael Coren writes for the Toronto Star, Globe and Mail, and New Statesman. His latest book is The Rebel Christ.

Discussion At the moment most people seem to be focused on how recent AI/LLM developments could affect their jobs and the economy. But there are huge numbers of people who believe in the existence of an invisible omnipotent being, in various flavours that there is zero verifiable evidence for, yet they take it extremely seriously. How are these myriad groups going to react to the imminent arrival of a super-intelligence that far surpasses our own, that they could actually reach out and touch, and that could meet many of the criteria of a new \"God\"? Are they going to switch allegiance en masse? Or will it make widespread religious tensions boil over into violence as they fight this upstart that threatens their worldview? Or could it perhaps usher in a new era where religious differences and tensions are forgotten about and we come together? Is this possibly going to be magnified by economic turbulence? Are there any precedents? I don't know, but it seems to me that a lot of people are going to be deeply affected. Does anyone have any insights?
