There’s a lot of information out there about AI. Some of it fact, some fiction, and some inspired by fiction. And since there’s so much information out there, it can be hard to know what to believe. Is AI dangerous? Will it take over all our jobs someday? Are we destined to live in the Matrix someday? In this article, we’ll discuss some of the biggest risks we face in the development of more advanced AI technologies. And we’ll also discuss which common beliefs are simply myths, or based on hype. In this article, we’ll cover: What is artificial intelligence? Can AI be dangerous? What are the risks of artificial intelligence? Real-life risks Hypothetical risks Why research AI safety? Do the benefits outweigh the risks? What is artificial intelligence? AI is a specific branch of computer science concerned with mimicking human thinking and decision-making processes. These programs can often revise their own algorithms by analyzing data sets and improving their own performance without needing the help of a human. These are often programmed to complete tasks that are too complex for non-AI machines. Learn more about AI. Can AI be dangerous? As with most things to do with AI, the answer to this question is complicated. There are some risks associated with AI, some pragmatic and some ethical. Leading experts debate how dangerous AI could be in the future, but there is no real consensus yet. However, there are a few dangers that experts agree upon. Many of these are purely hypothetical situations that may happen in the future without proper precautions, and some are real concerns that we deal with today. What are the risks of artificial intelligence? We talked briefly about real-life and hypothetical AI risks above. Below, we’ve outlined each in detail. Real-life risks include things like consumer privacy, legal issues, AI bias, and more. And the hypothetical future issues include things like AI programmed for harm, or AI developing destructive behaviors. Real-life AI risks There are a myriad of risks to do with AI that we deal with in our lives today. Not every AI risk is as big and worrisome as killer robots or sentient AI. Some of the biggest risks today include things like consumer privacy, biased programming, danger to humans, and unclear legal regulation. Privacy One of the biggest concerns experts cite is around consumer data privacy, security, and AI. Americans have a right to privacy, established in 1992 with the ratification of the International Covenant on on Civil and Political Rights. But many companies already skirt data privacy violations with their collection and use practices, and experts worry this may increase as we start utilizing more AI. Another major concern is that there are currently few regulations on AI (in general, or around data privacy) on the national or international level. The EU introduced the “AI Act” in April 2021 to regulate AI systems considered of risk; however, the act has not yet passed. AI bias It’s a common myth that since AI is a computer system, it is inherently unbiased. However, this is blatantly untrue. AI is only as unbiased as the data and people training the programs. So if the data is flawed, impartial, or biased in any way, the resulting AI will be biased as well. The two main types of bias in AI are “data bias” and “societal bias.” Data bias is when the data used to develop and train an AI is incomplete, skewed, or invalid. This can be because the data is incorrect, excludes certain groups, or was collected in bad faith. On the other hand, societal bias is when the assumptions and biases present in everyday society make their way into AI through blind spots and expectations that the programmers held when creating the AI.

Try Tableau for free Human interactivity In the past when AI was just spitting out predictions and robots navigating rooms full of chairs, the question of how humans and AI interacted was more of an existentialist query than a concern. But now, with AI permeating everyday life, the question becomes more pressing. How does interacting with AI affect humans? There are physical safety concerns. In 2018, a self-driving car used by the rideshare company Uber hit and killed a pedestrian in a driving accident. In that particular case, the court ruled that the backup driver of the self-driving car was at fault, as she was watching a show on her phone instead of paying attention to her surroundings. Beyond that scenario, there are others that could cause physical harm to humans. If companies rely too much on AI predictions for when maintenance will be done without other checks, it could lead to machinery malfunctions that injure workers. Models used in healthcare could cause misdiagnoses. And there are further, non-physical ways AI can harm humans if not carefully regulated. AI could cause issues with digital safety (causing defamation or libel), financial safety (this could be misuse of AI in financial recommendations, credit checks, or the opposite, such as complex schemes that steals or exploits financial information), or equity (biases built into AI that can cause unfair rejections or acceptances in a multitude of programs). Legal responsibility And, lastly, the question of legal responsibility, which has to do with almost all the other risks discussed above. When something goes wrong, who is responsible? The AI itself? The programmer who developed it? The company that implemented it? Or, if there was a human involved, is it the human operator’s fault? We talked above about a self-driving car that killed a pedestrian, where the backup driver was found at fault. But does that set the precedent for every case involving AI? Probably not, as the question is complex and ever-evolving. Different uses of AI will have different legal liabilities if something goes wrong. Hypothetical AI risks Now that we’ve covered the everyday risks of AI, we’ll talk a little about some of the hypothetical risks. These may not be as extreme as you might see in science fiction movies, but they’re still a concern and something that leading AI experts are working to prevent and regulate right now. AI programmed for harm Another risk that experts cite when talking about the risks of AI is the possibility that something that uses AI will be programmed to do something devastating. The best example of this is the idea of “autonomous weapons” which can be programmed to kill humans in war. Many countries have already banned autonomous weapons in war, but there are other ways AI could be programmed to harm humans. Experts worry that as AI evolves, it may be used for nefarious purposes and harm humanity. AI develops destructive behaviors Another concern, somewhat related to the last, is that AI will be given a beneficial goal, but will develop destructive behaviors as it attempts to accomplish that goal. An example of this could be an AI system tasked with something beneficial, such as helping to rebuild an endangered marine creature’s ecosystem. But in doing so, it may decide that other parts of the ecosystem are unimportant and destroy their habitats. And it could also view human intervention to fix or prevent this as a threat to its goal. Making sure that AI is fully and completely aligned to human goals is surprisingly difficult and takes careful programming. AI with ambiguous and ambitious goals are worrisome, as we don’t know what path it might decide to take to its given goal. Why research AI safety? Not that many years ago, the idea of superhuman AI seemed fanciful. But with recent developments in the field of AI, researchers now believe it may happen within the next few decades, though they don’t know exactly when. With these rapid advancements, it becomes even more important that the safety and regulation of AI be researched and discussed at the national and international levels. In 2015, many leading technology experts (including Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, and Steve Wozniak) signed an open letter on AI that called for research on the societal impacts of AI. Some of the concerns raised in the letter cover things like the ethics of autonomous weapons being used in war, and safety concerns around autonomous vehicles. In the longer term, the letter posits that unless care is taken, humans can easily lose control of AI and its goals and methods. The importance of AI safety is to keep humans safe and to ensure that proper regulations are in place to ensure that AI acts as it should. These issues may not seem immediate, but addressing them now can prevent much worse outcomes in the future. Do the benefits outweigh the risks? After reading through all the risks and dangers of AI outlined in this article, you may ask yourself, Is it even worth it? Well, the same open letter mentioned above also talks about the possible benefits that AI could have for society if used correctly. An attached article on research priorities states, “...we cannot predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools AI may provide, but the eradication of disease and poverty is not unfathomable.” The potential benefits of continuing forward with AI research are significant. And while, of course, there are risks to consider, the reward can be considered well worth it. Learn more about the advantages and disadvantages of AI here.

        "content": "12 Dangers of Artificial Intelligence (AI) | Built In Skip to main content Artificial IntelligenceData ScienceArtificial Intelligence+112 Risks and Dangers of Artificial Intelligence (AI)AI has been hailed as revolutionary and world-changing, but it’s not without drawbacks.Written byMike ThomasMike ThomasSenior Features Writer at Built InMike Thomas is a former Built In senior features writer covering technology trends and the software industry. He is a regular contributor to Chicago magazine and the author of two books. Image: Shutterstock Brennan WhitfieldStaff Reporter, Updates at Built InUPDATED BYBrennan Whitfield | Mar 01, 2024Artem OppermannResearch Engineer at BTC Embedded SystemsREVIEWED BYArtem Oppermann As AI grows more sophisticated and widespread, the voices warning against the potential dangers of artificial intelligence grow louder.“These things could get more intelligent than us and could decide to take over, and we need to worry now about how we prevent that happening,” said Geoffrey Hinton, known as the “Godfather of AI” for his foundational work on machine learning and neural network algorithms. In 2023, Hinton left his position at Google so that he could “talk about the dangers of AI,” noting a part of him even regrets his life’s work.The renowned computer scientist isn’t alone in his concerns.Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk, along with over 1,000 other tech leaders, urged in a 2023 open letter to put a pause on large AI experiments, citing that the technology can “pose profound risks to society and humanity.”Dangers of Artificial IntelligenceAutomation-spurred job lossDeepfakesPrivacy violationsAlgorithmic bias caused by bad dataSocioeconomic inequalityMarket volatilityWeapons automatizationUncontrollable self-aware AIWhether it’s the increasing automation of certain jobs, gender and racially biased algorithms or autonomous weapons that operate without human oversight (to name just a few), unease abounds on a number of fronts. And we’re still in the very early stages of what AI is really capable of. 12 Dangers of AIQuestions about who’s developing AI and for what purposes make it all the more essential to understand its potential downsides. Below we take a closer look at the possible dangers of artificial intelligence and explore how to manage its risks.Is AI Dangerous?The tech community has long debated the threats posed by artificial intelligence. Automation of jobs, the spread of fake news and a dangerous arms race of AI-powered weaponry have been mentioned as some of the biggest dangers posed by AI. 1. Lack of AI Transparency and Explainability AI and deep learning models can be difficult to understand, even for those that work directly with the technology. This leads to a lack of transparency for how and why AI comes to its conclusions, creating a lack of explanation for what data AI algorithms use, or why they may make biased or unsafe decisions. These concerns have given rise to the use of explainable AI, but there’s still a long way before transparent AI systems become common practice. 2. Job Losses Due to AI AutomationAI-powered job automation is a pressing concern as the technology is adopted in industries like marketing, manufacturing and healthcare. By 2030, tasks that account for up to 30 percent of hours currently being worked in the U.S. economy could be automated — with Black and Hispanic employees left especially vulnerable to the change — according to McKinsey. Goldman Sachs even states 300 million full-time jobs could be lost to AI automation.“The reason we have a low unemployment rate, which doesn’t actually capture people that aren’t looking for work, is largely that lower-wage service sector jobs have been pretty robustly created by this economy,” futurist Martin Ford told Built In. With AI on the rise, though, “I don’t think that’s going to continue.”As AI robots become smarter and more dexterous, the same tasks will require fewer humans. And while AI is estimated to create 97 million new jobs by 2025, many employees won’t have the skills needed for these technical roles and could get left behind if companies don’t upskill their workforces.“If you’re flipping burgers at McDonald’s and more automation comes in, is one of these new jobs going to be a good match for you?” Ford said. “Or is it likely that the new job requires lots of education or training or maybe even intrinsic talents — really strong interpersonal skills or creativity — that you might not have? Because those are the things that, at least so far, computers are not very good at.”Even professions that require graduate degrees and additional post-college training aren’t immune to AI displacement.As technology strategist Chris Messina has pointed out, fields like law and accounting are primed for an AI takeover. In fact, Messina said, some of them may well be decimated. AI already is having a significant impact on medicine. Law and accounting are next, Messina said, the former being poised for “a massive shakeup.”“Think about the complexity of contracts, and really diving in and understanding what it takes to create a perfect deal structure,” he said in regards to the legal field. “It’s a lot of attorneys reading through a lot of information — hundreds or thousands of pages of data and documents. It’s really easy to miss things. So AI that has the ability to comb through and comprehensively deliver the best possible contract for the outcome you’re trying to achieve is probably going to replace a lot of corporate attorneys.”More on Artificial IntelligenceAI Copywriting: Why Writing Jobs Are Safe 3. Social Manipulation Through AI AlgorithmsSocial manipulation also stands as a danger of artificial intelligence. This fear has become a reality as politicians rely on platforms to promote their viewpoints, with one example being Ferdinand Marcos, Jr., wielding a TikTok troll army to capture the votes of younger Filipinos during the Philippines’ 2022 election. TikTok, which is just one example of a social media platform that relies on AI algorithms, fills a user’s feed with content related to previous media they’ve viewed on the platform. Criticism of the app targets this process and the algorithm’s failure to filter out harmful and inaccurate content, raising concerns over TikTok’s ability to protect its users from misleading information. Online media and news have become even murkier in light of AI-generated images and videos, AI voice changers as well as deepfakes infiltrating political and social spheres. These technologies make it easy to create realistic photos, videos, audio clips or replace the image of one figure with another in an existing picture or video. As a result, bad actors have another avenue for sharing misinformation and war propaganda, creating a nightmare scenario where it can be nearly impossible to distinguish between creditable and faulty news. “No one knows what’s real and what’s not,” Ford said. “So it really leads to a situation where you literally cannot believe your own eyes and ears; you can’t rely on what, historically, we’ve considered to be the best possible evidence... That’s going to be a huge issue.”More on Artificial IntelligenceHow to Spot Deepfake Technology 4. Social Surveillance With AI TechnologyIn addition to its more existential threat, Ford is focused on the way AI will adversely affect privacy and security. A prime example is China’s use of facial recognition technology in offices, schools and other venues. Besides tracking a person’s movements, the Chinese government may be able to gather enough data to monitor a person’s activities, relationships and political views. Another example is U.S. police departments embracing predictive policing algorithms to anticipate where crimes will occur. The problem is that these algorithms are influenced by arrest rates, which disproportionately impact Black communities. Police departments then double down on these communities, leading to over-policing and questions over whether self-proclaimed democracies can resist turning AI into an authoritarian weapon.“Authoritarian regimes use or are going to use it,” Ford said. “The question is, How much does it invade Western countries, democracies, and what constraints do we put on it?”RelatedAre Police Robots the Future of Law Enforcement? 5. Lack of Data Privacy Using AI ToolsIf you’ve played around with an AI chatbot or tried out an AI face filter online, your data is being collected — but where is it going and how is it being used? AI systems often collect personal data to customize user experiences or to help train the AI models you’re using (especially if the AI tool is free). Data may not even be considered secure from other users when given to an AI system, as one bug incident that occurred with ChatGPT in 2023 “allowed some users to see titles from another active user’s chat history.” While there are laws present to protect personal information in some cases in the United States, there is no explicit federal law that protects citizens from data privacy harm experienced by AI. 6. Biases Due to AIVarious forms of AI bias are detrimental too. Speaking to the New York Times, Princeton computer science professor Olga Russakovsky said AI bias goes well beyond gender and race. In addition to data and algorithmic bias (the latter of which can “amplify” the former), AI is developed by humans — and humans are inherently biased.“A.I. researchers are primarily people who are male, who come from certain racial demographics, who grew up in high socioeconomic areas, primarily people without disabilities,” Russakovsky said. “We’re a fairly homogeneous population, so it’s a challenge to think broadly about world issues.”The limited experiences of AI creators may explain why speech-recognition AI often fails to understand certain dialects and accents, or why companies fail to consider the consequences of a chatbot impersonating notorious figures in human history. Developers and businesses should exercise greater care to avoid recreating powerful biases and prejudices that put minority populations at risk. 7. Socioeconomic Inequality as a Result of AI If companies refuse to acknowledge the inherent biases baked into AI algorithms, they may compromise their DEI initiatives through AI-powered recruiting. The idea that AI can measure the traits of a candidate through facial and voice analyses is still tainted by racial biases, reproducing the same discriminatory hiring practices businesses claim to be eliminating. Widening socioeconomic inequality sparked by AI-driven job loss is another cause for concern, revealing the class biases of how AI is applied. Workers who perform more manual, repetitive tasks have experienced wage declines as high as 70 percent because of automation, with office and desk workers remaining largely untouched in AI’s early stages. However, the increase in generative AI use is already affecting office jobs, making for a wide range of roles that may be more vulnerable to wage or job loss than others.Sweeping claims that AI has somehow overcome social boundaries or created more jobs fail to paint a complete picture of its effects. It’s crucial to account for differences based on race, class and other categories. Otherwise, discerning how AI and automation benefit certain individuals and groups at the expense of others becomes more difficult. 8. Weakening Ethics and Goodwill Because of AIAlong with technologists, journalists and political figures, even religious leaders are sounding the alarm on AI’s potential pitfalls. In a 2023 Vatican meeting and in his message for the 2024 World Day of Peace, Pope Francis called for nations to create and adopt a binding international treaty that regulates the development and use of AI.Pope Francis warned against AI’s ability to be misused, and “create statements that at first glance appear plausible but are unfounded or betray biases.” He stressed how this could bolster campaigns of disinformation, distrust in communications media, interference in elections and more — ultimately increasing the risk of “fueling conflicts and hindering peace.” The rapid rise of generative AI tools gives these concerns more substance. Many users have applied the technology to get out of writing assignments, threatening academic integrity and creativity. Plus, biased AI could be used to determine whether an individual is suitable for a job, mortgage, social assistance or political asylum, producing possible injustices and discrimination, noted Pope Francis. “The unique human capacity for moral judgment and ethical decision-making is more than a complex collection of algorithms,” he said. “And that capacity cannot be reduced to programming a machine.”More on Artificial IntelligenceWhat Are AI Ethics? 9. Autonomous Weapons Powered By AIAs is too often the case, technological advancements have been harnessed for the purpose of warfare. When it comes to AI, some are keen to do something about it before it’s too late: In a 2016 open letter, over 30,000 individuals, including AI and robotics researchers, pushed back against the investment in AI-fueled autonomous weapons. “The key question for humanity today is whether to start a global AI arms race or to prevent it from starting,” they wrote. “If any major military power pushes ahead with AI weapon development, a global arms race is virtually inevitable, and the endpoint of this technological trajectory is obvious: autonomous weapons will become the Kalashnikovs of tomorrow.”This prediction has come to fruition in the form of Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems, which locate and destroy targets on their own while abiding by few regulations. Because of the proliferation of potent and complex weapons, some of the world’s most powerful nations have given in to anxieties and contributed to a tech cold war. Many of these new weapons pose major risks to civilians on the ground, but the danger becomes amplified when autonomous weapons fall into the wrong hands. Hackers have mastered various types of cyber attacks, so it’s not hard to imagine a malicious actor infiltrating autonomous weapons and instigating absolute armageddon. If political rivalries and warmongering tendencies are not kept in check, artificial intelligence could end up being applied with the worst intentions. Some fear that, no matter how many powerful figures point out the dangers of artificial intelligence, we’re going to keep pushing the envelope with it if there’s money to be made. “The mentality is, ‘If we can do it, we should try it; let’s see what happens,” Messina said. “‘And if we can make money off it, we’ll do a whole bunch of it.’ But that’s not unique to technology. That’s been happening forever.’” 10. Financial Crises Brought About By AI AlgorithmsThe financial industry has become more receptive to AI technology’s involvement in everyday finance and trading processes. As a result, algorithmic trading could be responsible for our next major financial crisis in the markets.While AI algorithms aren’t clouded by human judgment or emotions, they also don’t take into account contexts, the interconnectedness of markets and factors like human trust and fear. These algorithms then make thousands of trades at a blistering pace with the goal of selling a few seconds later for small profits. Selling off thousands of trades could scare investors into doing the same thing, leading to sudden crashes and extreme market volatility.Instances like the 2010 Flash Crash and the Knight Capital Flash Crash serve as reminders of what could happen when trade-happy algorithms go berserk, regardless of whether rapid and massive trading is intentional. This isn’t to say that AI has nothing to offer to the finance world. In fact, AI algorithms can help investors make smarter and more informed decisions on the market. But finance organizations need to make sure they understand their AI algorithms and how those algorithms make decisions. Companies should consider whether AI raises or lowers their confidence before introducing the technology to avoid stoking fears among investors and creating financial chaos. 11. Loss of Human InfluenceAn overreliance on AI technology could result in the loss of human influence — and a lack in human functioning — in some parts of society. Using AI in healthcare could result in reduced human empathy and reasoning, for instance. And applying generative AI for creative endeavors could diminish human creativity and emotional expression. Interacting with AI systems too much could even cause reduced peer communication and social skills. So while AI can be very helpful for automating daily tasks, some question if it might hold back overall human intelligence, abilities and need for community. 12. Uncontrollable Self-Aware AIThere also comes a worry that AI will progress in intelligence so rapidly that it will become sentient, and act beyond humans’ control — possibly in a malicious manner. Alleged reports of this sentience have already been occurring, with one popular account being from a former Google engineer who stated the AI chatbot LaMDA was sentient and speaking to him just as a person would. As AI’s next big milestones involve making systems with artificial general intelligence, and eventually artificial superintelligence, cries to completely stop these developments continue to rise.More on Artificial IntelligenceWhat Is the Eliza Effect? How to Mitigate the Risks of AIAI still has numerous benefits, like organizing health data and powering self-driving cars. To get the most out of this promising technology, though, some argue that plenty of regulation is necessary.“There’s a serious danger that we’ll get [AI systems] smarter than us fairly soon and that these things might get bad motives and take control,” Hinton told NPR. “This isn’t just a science fiction problem. This is a serious problem that’s probably going to arrive fairly soon, and politicians need to be thinking about what to do about it now.” Develop Legal RegulationsAI regulation has been a main focus for dozens of countries, and now the U.S. and European Union are creating more clear-cut measures to manage the rising sophistication of artificial intelligence. In fact, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) published the AI Bill of Rights in 2022, a document outlining to help responsibly guide AI use and development. Additionally, President Joe Biden issued an executive order in 2023 requiring federal agencies to develop new rules and guidelines for AI safety and security.Although legal regulations mean certain AI technologies could eventually be banned, it doesn’t prevent societies from exploring the field. Ford argues that AI is essential for countries looking to innovate and keep up with the rest of the world.“You regulate the way AI is used, but you don’t hold back progress in basic technology. I think that would be wrong-headed and potentially dangerous,” Ford said. “We decide where we want AI and where we don’t; where it’s acceptable and where it’s not. And different countries are going to make different choices.”More on Artificial IntelligenceWill This Election Year Be a Turning Point for AI Regulation? Establish Organizational AI Standards and DiscussionsOn a company level, there are many steps businesses can take when integrating AI into their operations. Organizations can develop processes for monitoring algorithms, compiling high-quality data and explaining the findings of AI algorithms. Leaders could even make AI a part of their company culture and routine business discussions, establishing standards to determine acceptable AI technologies.An error occurred.Unable to execute JavaScript.

Stanford University AI researchers Fei-Fei Li and John Etchemendy make this argument in a 2019 blog post that calls for national and global leadership in regulating artificial intelligence: “The creators of AI must seek the insights, experiences and concerns of people across ethnicities, genders, cultures and socio-economic groups, as well as those from other fields, such as economics, law, medicine, philosophy, history, sociology, communications, human-computer-interaction, psychology, and Science and Technology Studies (STS).”Balancing high-tech innovation with human-centered thinking is an ideal method for producing responsible AI technology and ensuring the future of AI remains hopeful for the next generation. The dangers of artificial intelligence should always be a topic of discussion, so leaders can figure out ways to wield the technology for noble purposes. “I think we can talk about all these risks, and they’re very real,” Ford said. “But AI is also going to be the most important tool in our toolbox for solving the biggest challenges we face.” Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat is AI?AI (artificial intelligence) describes a machine's ability to perform tasks and mimic intelligence at a similar level as humans.Is AI dangerous?AI has the potential to be dangerous, but these dangers may be mitigated by implementing legal regulations and by guiding AI development with human-centered thinking.Can AI cause human extinction?If AI algorithms are biased or used in a malicious manner — such as in the form of deliberate disinformation campaigns or autonomous lethal weapons — they could cause significant harm toward humans. Though as of right now, it is unknown whether AI is capable of causing human extinction.What happens if AI becomes self-aware?Self-aware AI has yet to be created, so it is not fully known what will happen if or when this development occurs.Some suggest self-aware AI may become a helpful counterpart to humans in everyday living, while others suggest that it may act beyond human control and purposely harm humans.

Report this article Dr. Hitesh Mohapatra Dr. Hitesh Mohapatra Associate Professor, Researcher & Software Engineer Published Jun 27, 2023 + Follow Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to pose certain risks and challenges to humanity if it is not properly managed or used irresponsibly. Here are some ways in which AI could be considered a threat:1. Job Displacement: AI and automation technologies can automate various tasks and jobs, leading to potential job losses for humans. Industries such as manufacturing, transportation, and customer service are already witnessing the effects of automation. While AI may create new job opportunities, there is a risk of significant job displacement in certain sectors, which could result in economic and social challenges.2. Bias and Discrimination: AI systems are trained on large datasets, which may contain biases and prejudices present in society. If these biases are not addressed, AI algorithms can perpetuate and amplify existing social biases, leading to discriminatory outcomes. This can affect areas such as hiring processes, criminal justice systems, and access to services, exacerbating societal inequalities.3. Privacy and Surveillance: With the increasing use of AI-powered technologies, there is a concern about the potential erosion of privacy. AI systems can collect and analyze vast amounts of personal data, leading to potential privacy breaches and surveillance. If misused, AI can infringe upon individual privacy rights and lead to a surveillance state.4. Security Risks: AI can be exploited by malicious actors for various purposes, including cyber attacks, misinformation campaigns, and social engineering. As AI becomes more advanced, it could potentially be used to create sophisticated hacking tools, deepfake videos, or autonomous weapons systems, posing significant security threats.5. Lack of Accountability and Ethical Concerns: AI systems are often complex and operate using algorithms that are not always fully transparent or understandable to humans. This lack of transparency can raise concerns about accountability, as it becomes challenging to determine how decisions are being made or to identify potential biases or errors in the system. Additionally, ethical dilemmas arise when programming AI systems to make decisions that have moral implications, such as self-driving cars choosing whom to save in a potential accident.It is important to note that while these concerns exist, AI also holds great potential for positive impact and benefits to society. Addressing the risks associated with AI requires responsible development, robust regulations, and ethical considerations to ensure that its deployment aligns with human values and promotes the well-being of individuals and communities.Future impact of AI on the job market!The future impact of AI on the job market is a topic of ongoing debate and speculation. While AI has the potential to automate certain tasks and jobs, it is important to understand that it is also likely to create new job opportunities and transform existing roles. Here are some key points to consider regarding the future impact of AI on the job market:1. Job Displacement: AI and automation technologies can replace or reduce the need for human involvement in certain tasks and jobs. Repetitive and routine tasks that can be automated are more likely to be affected. This could impact sectors such as manufacturing, transportation, data entry, and customer service. However, it is important to note that the complete automation of entire job categories is less common. Instead, certain tasks within jobs are more likely to be automated, leading to a shift in job roles and skill requirements.2. Job Transformation: AI has the potential to augment human capabilities and transform job roles rather than completely replacing them. It can automate mundane tasks, allowing humans to focus on higher-value work that requires creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence. Jobs may evolve to incorporate more strategic decision-making, problem-solving, and human interaction, which are areas where machines currently lack proficiency.3. New Job Opportunities: AI is also likely to create new job opportunities. The development, implementation, and maintenance of AI systems require specialized skills and expertise. These include AI programming, data analysis, machine learning, algorithm development, and ethical considerations in AI development. As AI continues to advance, new roles and professions may emerge to support its development, implementation, and ethical governance.4. Skill Shift: The impact of AI on the job market emphasizes the importance of acquiring and developing certain skills. As routine and repetitive tasks become automated, there will be an increasing demand for skills that complement AI technology. Skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, creativity, adaptability, emotional intelligence, and complex social interactions are likely to become more valuable in the job market.5. Lifelong Learning: The rapid advancement of AI highlights the need for continuous learning and upskilling throughout one's career. As job roles evolve and new technologies emerge, individuals will need to adapt and acquire new skills to remain relevant in the job market. Lifelong learning, reskilling, and upskilling initiatives will become increasingly important to ensure individuals can thrive in a changing job landscape.It is important to approach the future impact of AI on the job market with a balanced perspective. While certain jobs may be displaced or transformed, new opportunities are also likely to arise. The overall impact will depend on various factors, including the rate of AI adoption, societal and economic considerations, and the ability of individuals and organizations to adapt to the changing landscape.How to deal with AI so that jobs can be saved for humans?To deal with AI in a way that preserves jobs for humans, several strategies can be considered. Here are some approaches that can help mitigate the potential job displacement caused by AI:1. Embrace Skill Enhancement and Lifelong Learning: As AI technology advances, it is crucial for individuals to continuously update and expand their skill sets. Encouraging lifelong learning and providing access to education and training programs can help workers acquire new skills that are complementary to AI technologies. Governments, educational institutions, and employers can play a role in promoting and facilitating reskilling and upskilling initiatives.2. Foster Collaboration between Humans and AI: Instead of viewing AI as a complete replacement for human workers, emphasize the collaborative potential between humans and AI systems. AI can be used to augment human capabilities, automate repetitive tasks and provide support for decision-making processes. Encouraging the integration of AI as a tool to enhance human productivity can lead to job enrichment rather than job displacement.3. Promote Entrepreneurship and Innovation: Encouraging entrepreneurship and supporting the development of new businesses can create job opportunities and drive economic growth. Entrepreneurs can leverage AI technologies to create innovative solutions and develop new industries. Governments can provide support through funding, mentorship programs, and regulatory frameworks that foster innovation and entrepreneurship.4. Invest in AI Education and Research: Building a strong foundation in AI education and research is essential for creating a workforce that can harness the potential of AI. Investments in AI-related education and research initiatives can help develop expertise, drive innovation, and ensure the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies. This includes funding academic programs, research institutes, and AI-focused initiatives.5. Ensure Ethical AI Development and Deployment: Ethics should be at the forefront of AI development and deployment. Establishing guidelines and regulations that prioritize transparency, fairness, and accountability can help mitigate potential risks and ensure that AI technologies are used in a way that benefits society as a whole. Responsible AI practices involve addressing biases, ensuring privacy protection, and considering the social impact of AI systems.6. Create Supportive Workforce Policies: Governments and organizations can implement policies that support workers during periods of job transitions caused by AI. This includes providing unemployment benefits, job placement services, and income support programs. Implementing measures that encourage a smooth transition for workers, such as job-sharing or reduced work hours, can help minimize the negative impact of job displacement.7. Foster Collaboration between Stakeholders: Collaboration between governments, industry leaders, academia, and civil society is crucial for shaping AI policies and ensuring that the benefits of AI are distributed equitably. Engaging in open dialogues, establishing multidisciplinary task forces, and fostering partnerships can help address the challenges and opportunities presented by AI technology.By implementing these strategies, it is possible to harness the potential of AI while safeguarding jobs for humans. It requires a proactive and collaborative approach from various stakeholders to ensure that AI technology is developed and deployed in a manner that aligns with societal needs and values.................“The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race….It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever-increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn’t compete, and would be superseded.”Stephen Hawking, BBC Technology for All Technology for All 728 followers + Subscribe Like Comment Copy LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Share 16 To view or add a comment, sign in More articles by this author No more previous content All AI Generative Tools Smell Like TRAP!

The 15 Biggest Risks Of Artificial IntelligenceAdobe Stock AI does present some significant dangers — from job displacement to security and privacy concerns — and encouraging awareness of issues helps us engage in conversations about AI's legal, ethical, and societal implications. Here are the biggest risks of artificial intelligence: 1. Lack of Transparency Lack of transparency in AI systems, particularly in deep learning models that can be complex and difficult to interpret, is a pressing issue. This opaqueness obscures the decision-making processes and underlying logic of these technologies. When people can’t comprehend how an AI system arrives at its conclusions, it can lead to distrust and resistance to adopting these technologies.

Bias and Discrimination AI systems can inadvertently perpetuate or amplify societal biases due to biased training data or algorithmic design. To minimize discrimination and ensure fairness, it is crucial to invest in the development of unbiased algorithms and diverse training data sets. 3. Privacy Concerns AI technologies often collect and analyze large amounts of personal data, raising issues related to data privacy and security. To mitigate privacy risks, we must advocate for strict data protection regulations and safe data handling practices. 4. Ethical Dilemmas Instilling moral and ethical values in AI systems, especially in decision-making contexts with significant consequences, presents a considerable challenge. Researchers and developers must prioritize the ethical implications of AI technologies to avoid negative societal impacts. 5. Security Risks As AI technologies become increasingly sophisticated, the security risks associated with their use and the potential for misuse also increase. Hackers and malicious actors can harness the power of AI to develop more advanced cyberattacks, bypass security measures, and exploit vulnerabilities in systems. The rise of AI-driven autonomous weaponry also raises concerns about the dangers of rogue states or non-state actors using this technology — especially when we consider the potential loss of human control in critical decision-making processes. To mitigate these security risks, governments and organizations need to develop best practices for secure AI development and deployment and foster international cooperation to establish global norms and regulations that protect against AI security threats. 6. Concentration of Power The risk of AI development being dominated by a small number of large corporations and governments could exacerbate inequality and limit diversity in AI applications. Encouraging decentralized and collaborative AI development is key to avoiding a concentration of power. 7. Dependence on AI Overreliance on AI systems may lead to a loss of creativity, critical thinking skills, and human intuition. Striking a balance between AI-assisted decision-making and human input is vital to preserving our cognitive abilities. 8. Job Displacement AI-driven automation has the potential to lead to job losses across various industries, particularly for low-skilled workers (although there is evidence that AI and other emerging technologies will create more jobs than it eliminates). As AI technologies continue to develop and become more efficient, the workforce must adapt and acquire new skills to remain relevant in the changing landscape. This is especially true for lower-skilled workers in the current labor force. 9. Economic Inequality AI has the potential to contribute to economic inequality by disproportionally benefiting wealthy individuals and corporations. As we talked about above, job losses due to AI-driven automation are more likely to affect low-skilled workers, leading to a growing income gap and reduced opportunities for social mobility. The concentration of AI development and ownership within a small number of large corporations and governments can exacerbate this inequality as they accumulate wealth and power while smaller businesses struggle to compete. Policies and initiatives that promote economic equity—like reskilling programs, social safety nets, and inclusive AI development that ensures a more balanced distribution of opportunities — can help combat economic inequality. 10. Legal and Regulatory Challenges It’s crucial to develop new legal frameworks and regulations to address the unique issues arising from AI technologies, including liability and intellectual property rights. Legal systems must evolve to keep pace with technological advancements and protect the rights of everyone. 11. AI Arms Race The risk of countries engaging in an AI arms race could lead to the rapid development of AI technologies with potentially harmful consequences. Recently, more than a thousand technology researchers and leaders, including Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, have urged intelligence labs to pause the development of advanced AI systems. The letter states that AI tools present “profound risks to society and humanity.” In the letter, the leaders said: \"Humanity can enjoy a flourishing future with AI. Having succeeded in creating powerful AI systems, we can now enjoy an 'AI summer' in which we reap the rewards, engineer these systems for the clear benefit of all, and give society a chance to adapt.\" 12. Loss of Human Connection Increasing reliance on AI-driven communication and interactions could lead to diminished empathy, social skills, and human connections. To preserve the essence of our social nature, we must strive to maintain a balance between technology and human interaction. 13. Misinformation and Manipulation AI-generated content, such as deepfakes, contributes to the spread of false information and the manipulation of public opinion. Efforts to detect and combat AI-generated misinformation are critical in preserving the integrity of information in the digital age. In a Stanford University study on the most pressing dangers of AI, researchers said: “AI systems are being used in the service of disinformation on the internet, giving them the potential to become a threat to democracy and a tool for fascism. From deepfake videos to online bots manipulating public discourse by feigning consensus and spreading fake news, there is the danger of AI systems undermining social trust. The technology can be co-opted by criminals, rogue states, ideological extremists, or simply special interest groups, to manipulate people for economic gain or political advantage.” 14. Unintended Consequences AI systems, due to their complexity and lack of human oversight, might exhibit unexpected behaviors or make decisions with unforeseen consequences. This unpredictability can result in outcomes that negatively impact individuals, businesses, or society as a whole. Robust testing, validation, and monitoring processes can help developers and researchers identify and fix these types of issues before they escalate. 15. Existential Risks The development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) that surpasses human intelligence raises long-term concerns for humanity. The prospect of AGI could lead to unintended and potentially catastrophic consequences, as these advanced AI systems may not be aligned with human values or priorities. To mitigate these risks, the AI research community needs to actively engage in safety research, collaborate on ethical guidelines, and promote transparency in AGI development. Ensuring that AGI serves the best interests of humanity and does not pose a threat to our existence is paramount.

What should enterprises make of the recent warnings about AI's threat to humanity? AI experts and ethicists offer opinions and practical advice for managing AI risk. Share this item with your network: By George Lawton Published: 17 Jul 2023 Rapid innovation in AI has fueled debate among industry experts about the existential threat posed by machines that can perform tasks previously done by humans. Doomsayers argue that artificial general intelligence -- a machine that's able to think and experience the world like a human -- will happen sooner than expected and will outwit us. Shorter term, they warn our overreliance on AI systems could spell disaster: Disinformation will flood the internet, terrorists will craft new dangerous and cheap weapons, and killer drones could run rampant. Even Geoffrey Hinton, widely seen as the \"godfather of AI\" for his seminal work on neural networks, has expressed growing concerns over AI's threat to humanity, issuing a warning in May about the rapidly advancing abilities of generative AI chatbots, like ChatGPT. \"Right now, they're not more intelligent than us, as far as I can tell. But I think they soon may be,\" he told the BBC, forecasting a span of five to 10 years before this happens, as opposed to his previous timeline of 30 to 50 years. Rising concerns about AI's existential risks have led to a call for a six-month moratorium on AI research -- an AI pause -- promulgated through an open letter signed by many industry and academic experts, including executives at many companies fueling AI innovation. This article is part of What is generative AI? Everything you need to know Which also includes: 8 top generative AI tool categories for 2024 Will AI replace jobs? 9 job types that might be affected 16 of the best large language models Davi Ottenheimer Others argue, however, that this AI doomerism narrative distracts from more likely AI dangers enterprises urgently need to heed: AI bias, inequity, inequality, hallucinations, new failure modes, privacy risks and security breaches. A big concern among people in this group is that a pause might create a protective moat for major AI companies, like OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT and an AI pause advocate. \"Releasing ChatGPT to the public while calling it dangerous seems little more than a cynical ploy by those planning to capitalize on fears without solving them,\" said Davi Ottenheimer, vice president of trust and digital ethics at Inrupt. He noted that a bigger risk may lie in enabling AI doomsayers to profit by abusing our trust. Abhishek Gupta Responsible AI or virtue signaling? Signed letters calling for an AI pause get a lot of media play, agreed Abhishek Gupta, founder and principal researcher at the Montreal AI Ethics Institute, but they beg the question of what happens next. \"I find it difficult to sign letters that primarily serve as virtue signaling without any tangible action or the necessary clarity to back them up,\" he said. \"In my opinion, such letters are counterproductive as they consume attention cycles without leading to any real change.\" Doomsday narratives confuse the discourse and potentially put a lid on the kind of levelheaded conversation required to make sound policy decisions, he said. Additionally, these media-fueled debates consume valuable time and resources that could instead be used to gain deeper understanding of AI use cases. \"For executives seeking to manage risks associated with AI effectively, they must first and foremost educate themselves on actual risks versus falsely presented existential threats,\" Gupta said. They also need to collaborate with technical experts who have practical experience in developing production-grade AI systems, as well as with academic professionals who work on the theoretical foundations of AI. Eliott Behar Building consensus on what needs to be tackled to ensure responsible AI programs should not be that hard, according to Eliott Behar, technology and human rights lawyer at Eliott Behar Law and former security counsel at Apple. \"Most people seem to agree that the existing state of big tech is problematic and that the way these companies are using data is somewhere at the heart of the problem,\" Behar said. What's required, he added, is a greater focus on how to let users see, understand and exercise control over how their data gets processed. Brian Green What are realistic AI risks? If AI doomerism is not likely to prove useful in controlling AI risks, how should enterprises be thinking about the problem? Brian Green, director of technology ethics at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University, said it's helpful to frame AI risks as those that come from the AI itself and risks that come from the use of AI by humans. Risks from the AI itself range from simple errors in computation that lead to bad outcomes to AI gaining a will of its own and deciding to attack humankind, said Green, author of Ethics in the Age of Disruptive Technologies: An Operational Roadmap, a newly published handbook that lays out what he considers practical steps organizations can take to make ethical decisions. (He stressed that, at present, there is no clear way by which the latter could happen.) The human use of AI covers everything humans can imagine could be automated and made more efficiently evil with AI: more centralized or hair-trigger control of nuclear weapons, more powerful disinformation campaigns, deadlier biological weapons, more effective planning for social control and so on. \"Everything horrible that human intelligence can do, artificial intelligence might be programmed to do as well as or better than humans,\" Green said. \"There are vastly more chances that humans might use AI for existentially risky purposes than there are chances that AI would just pursue these goals on its own.\" Green believes that the realistic AI existential risks we face are more mundane: AI-generated content trained to catch our attention that inadvertently blinds us to important issues or AI-based marketing apps trained to lure us into buying products and services that are detrimental to our well-being. \"I would argue that both of these things are already happening, so this possible existential AI risk is already upon us and is, therefore, 100% real,\" Green said. It's important to keep on top of known problems, such as AI bias and misalignment with organizational objectives, he said. \"Immediate problems that are ignored can turn into big problems later, and conversely, it is easier to solve big problems later if you first get some practice solving problems now.\" Andrew Pery Could AI stir up social unrest by displacing workers? How AI technology is changing the nature of work is one of those issues companies should be focusing on now, according to Andrew Pery, AI ethics evangelist at Abbyy, an intelligent automation company. \"With the commercialization of generative AI, the magnitude of labor disruption could be unprecedented,\" he said, referring to a Goldman Sachs report predicting that generative AI could expose the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs to automation. \"Such a dramatic displacement of labor is a recipe for growing social tensions by shifting millions of people to the margins of society with unsustainable unemployment levels and without the dignity of work that gives us meaning,\" Pery said. This may, in turn, give rise to more nefarious and dangerous uses of generative AI technology that subvert the foundations of a rule-based order, he added. Fostering digital upskilling for new jobs and rethinking social safety net programs will play a pivotal role in safely transitioning into an age of AI, he said. How enterprises can manage AI risks A key component of responsible AI is identifying and mitigating risks that could arise from AI systems, Gupta said. These risks can manifest in various forms, including but not limited to data privacy breaches, biased outputs, AI hallucinations, deliberate attacks on AI systems, and concentration of power in compute and data. Gupta recommended enterprises and stakeholders take a holistic and proactive approach that considers the potential impact of each AI risk across different domains and stakeholders to prioritize these risk scenarios effectively. This requires a deep understanding of AI systems and their algorithmic biases, the data inputs used to train and test the models, and the potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors that hackers or malicious actors may exploit. AI risk heat map A practical approach may be to apply the same methods used in cybersecurity, that is, evaluating various risks according to their probability and severity of impact. Many risks have not been identified yet, so Gupta recommended distinguishing between areas of uncertainty and risk. Uncertainty considers the unknown unknowns, while risk refers to assessment based on known unknowns. Trustworthy AI pledge Pery suggested that enterprises make a top-down organizational commitment to trustworthy AI principles and guidelines. Trustworthy AI includes human-centered values of fairness of AI outcomes, accuracy, integrity, confidentiality, security, accountability and transparency associated with the use of AI. Organizations that offer frameworks for trustworthy AI include the following: Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society. Stanford Center for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. AI Now Institute. In addition, the NIST AI Risk Management Framework provides a comprehensive roadmap for implementing responsible AI best practices and a model for mitigating potential AI harms. Other standards that organizations might consider include the ISO/IEC 23894 framework and the EU-sponsored AI governance framework by the European Committee for Standardization and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization. Nick Amabile Checklist of questions for monitoring AI Enterprises should institute measures for human oversight that ensure continuous monitoring of AI system performance. Measures can include identifying potential deviations from expected outcomes, taking remediation steps to correct adverse outcomes and including processes for overriding automated decisions by AI systems. Nick Amabile, CEO at DAS42, a data and analytics consultancy, said putting the right people and processes around data governance, data literacy, training and enablement is important. It's helpful to consider how existing tools for governing the security and privacy of data could be extended to manage the AI algorithms trained on this data. Kimberly Nevala Kimberly Nevala, strategic advisor at SAS, recommended companies spend quality time considering questions such as the following: How will and could this solution go astray or make errors? Is intentional misuse probable and in what circumstances? How might the system be inadvertently misunderstood or misapplied? What are the impacts, and how do they scale? Does the system's design exacerbate or attenuate the potential for misuse and misunderstanding? How might this system be integrated into or influence others within and beyond our scope of control? What might be the second- or third-order effects thereof? Will AI regulation help or harm? Governments worldwide are starting to draft new AI regulations that may prevent some of the worst AI risks. Poorly drafted regulations may also slow the helpful adoption of AI applications that solve some of our most pressing problems in healthcare and sustainable development or create new problems. \"In many cases, I think regulation will stifle innovation and create a regulatory moat around incumbent companies and limit competition, innovation and disruption from startups,\" Amabile said. Behar said that effective AI regulation requires being specific about the processes and requirements to make AI transparent, understandable and safe. \"Drafting broad laws that focus essentially on whether a process is ultimately 'harmful' or not won't take us nearly far enough,\" he said. According to Behar, discussions about regulating AI could take a cue from the regulation that helped us transition through the Industrial Revolution, including specifics like minimum safety standards for work conditions, minimum pay requirements, child labor restrictions and environmental standards. The AI equivalent would address how processes should be regulated, including how they use data; whether and how they drive decisions; and how we can ensure that their processes remain transparent, understandable and accountable. Tackling existential AI risks will require identifying and addressing the present dangers of the AI systems we are deploying today, Nevala said. \"This is an issue that will only be addressed through a combination of public literacy and pressure, regulation and law and -- history sadly suggests-- after a yet-to-be-determined critical threshold of actual harm has occurred,\" Nevala said.
