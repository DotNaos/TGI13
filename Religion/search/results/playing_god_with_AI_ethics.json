Report this article Ayesha Reed Ayesha Reed Charles Tyrwhitt Published Apr 22, 2023 + Follow The debate has been raging online since we collectively realised just how powerful the initial rollout of AI was. Some of loudest voices came from artists, education professionals and marketers about just how bad this was for hardworking employees that were under the risk of being replaced by automation, or having their creativity made redundant. On the other hand, there was huge praise from the healthcare and finance world about the potential strides and advancements that could be made through the utilisation of this technology. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have made remarkable developments, transforming various industries and sectors. The innovations in AI and ML have brought about unprecedented opportunities and challenges, raising ethical questions about the potential risks and benefits of these technologies. One pressing question is whether the next generation of AI and ML is \"playing God,\" and if charities should utilize them.The way we understand and analyse complex data, make predictions, and automate tasks has been completely revolutionised. AI and ML can process vast amounts of information and identify patterns that may not be readily apparent to humans, all within seconds. AI and ML are also being used to develop innovative solutions to global challenges such as climate change, poverty, and healthcare access. This is all good, right? If we just use it for things like this, then what’s the problem? Some critics argue that the increasing capabilities of AI and ML raise ethical concerns about the potential for these technologies to play God. It’s a bold claim to make. Yet, Moore’s Law claims that we can expect the speed and capability of our computers to increase every two years. The concern is that AI and ML may surpass human capabilities and result in unintended consequences, such as bias, discrimination, and loss of human agency, and those are just the lowest tier of concerns voiced.Another area of concern is the use of AI and ML in decision-making processes, such as in hiring and criminal justice. These technologies rely on algorithms that are trained on large datasets, which may contain biases and perpetuate discrimination against certain groups. This raises ethical concerns about fairness, accountability, and transparency in the use of AI and ML, as they may exacerbate existing inequalities and undermine human autonomy. When so much effort has been put into implementing EDI strategies into the workplace, this would be a huge step back if true. Given these ethical concerns, should charities utilize AI and ML in their operations and programs? Charities are organizations that aim to make a positive impact on society, addressing social issues and supporting those in need. The bottom line is, they rely on donations and resources to fulfil their missions and achieve their goals.Proponents of using AI and ML in charities argue that these technologies can enhance their ability to make a difference. For example, AI and ML can help charities automate administrative tasks, such as donor management and resource allocation, freeing up resources for more impactful work. Moreover, AI and ML can enable charities to reach a wider audience and engage donors more effectively through personalized recommendations and targeted campaigns. All this points in the direction of more money, and the ability to use all that freed up time to put it to good use. The best part is that charities can then re-utilise that same AI to put out content of all that work they’ve been doing to use the money raised for good causes. However, it is crucial for charities to carefully consider the ethical implications of using AI and ML. Charities need to ensure that these technologies are used responsibly, transparently, and with consideration for potential biases and unintended consequences. They should also prioritize human values, ethics, and human rights in their AI and ML applications, and actively work to mitigate any potential harms. Charities can collaborate with researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders to advocate for ethical guidelines, regulations, and standards in the field of AI and ML. By actively participating in the ethical discourse around AI and ML, charities can contribute to ensuring that these technologies are used in a way that aligns with their missions and values.The next generation of AI and ML presents unprecedented opportunities and challenges for charities and other organizations. While these technologies have the potential to enhance the impact of charities, there are ethical concerns about all this goodness going off on the wrong trajectory. However, it’s easy to get carried away with bold claims about the future of AI and humanity. The best we can do is take it as it comes and be cautious with its power.#AI #MachineLearning #Marketing #Charity #NFP Help improve contributions Mark contributions as unhelpful if you find them irrelevant or not valuable to the article.

Playing God refers to assuming powers of decision, intervention, or control metaphorically reserved to God. Acts described as playing God may include, for example, deciding who should live or die in a situation where not everyone can be saved, the use and development of biotechnologies such as synthetic biology,[1] and in vitro fertilisation.[2] Usually the expression is used pejoratively and to criticize or argue against the supposedly God-like actions.[3][4] Description[edit] Playing God is a broad concept, which is encompassed by both theological and scientific topics. When the term is used, it can be used to refer to people who try to exercise great authority and power. It is usually pejorative and suggests arrogance, misappropriation of power, or tampering with matters in which humans should not meddle. Etymology[edit] The official theatrical poster for Frankenstein (1931). In one scene (censored from the final film), Dr. Frankenstein proclaimed, \"Now I know what it feels like to be God!\" Playing God generally refers to someone using their power to make decisions regarding the fate of another's life or many lives. Theologian Paul Ramsey is noted for saying, \"Men ought not to play God before they learn to be men, and after they have learned to be men they will not play God.\" The religious framework of approach to this phrase refers to said religion's deity having a set plan for mankind, therefore man's hubris may lead to the misuse of technology related to sacred life or nature.[5] Other famous literary texts that allude to a man and God complex include Men Like Gods by H. G. Wells and You Shall Be Gods by Erich Fromm. The notion of god-like knowledge or power in humans goes back at least to the story of forbidden fruit in Genesis 3:4–5 whose traditional English translation includes the words \"ye shall be as gods\". History[edit] \"Creation of the Man\" by Prometheus, 4th-c.CE roman sarcophagus. Marble. Throughout history, many cultures have had stories and mythologies that depict figures that have attempted to deify themselves, whether intentionally or unintentionally. The famous myth of Prometheus in ancient Greece tells the tale of someone who stole from the Gods and gave to the people, and whilst he was punished for eternity, he was also hailed as a champion of the people. Apart from mythology, many contemporary thinkers, scientists, and books have argued for and against the case of playing God, and why it is necessary or unnecessary for the human race to take on the mantle. In more modern history, there have been many scientific projects, which have been considered to be attempted acts of playing God. Biomedical projects such as the attempted creation of artificial sperm and the creation of artificial life itself have brought the sci-fi stories of the 1900s out of fantasy and closer to reality. Other projects scientists have attempted include cloning (Dolly the sheep), even bringing back other extinct species that were previously thought to have been lost to time and could possibly be reintroduced to the wild. The fairly recent discovery of DNA has led to scientists toying with the idea that perhaps human genetics could be edited and possibly improved, despite there being opposition regarding unknown and possibly dire consequences. Philip Ball has argued that \"playing God\" is a meaningless and dangerous cliché that has no basis in theology. He claims that it was adopted as a rhetorical weapon by bioethicist \"theocons\", and owes its origin as a meme to the 1931 film version of Frankenstein, and has been used by journalists to refer to things they disagree with.[6] Alexandre Erler, in response to Ball, has argued that while the phrase is not meaningless, it is extremely vague and requires further clarification for it to be useful within the context of an argument.[7] Practices[edit] Bioethics[edit] The most common form of \"playing God\" in the modern era is attributed to bioethics. Bioethics refers to ethical issues regarding biological science, medicine etc. IVF treatment, abortion, genetic engineering, and artificial insemination are a few of the major topics regarding synthetic reproduction. Cloning was the centre of the playing God topic for decades and is still a taboo scientific subject due to this. Nicholas Hartsoeker in 1694 studied sperm under a microscope and the diagram he proposed for what sperm was, a homunculus in the head of the human sperm. A very little human was said to be observed, and this continued an Aristotelian thought that the sperm was in fact, a sacred little person.[8] Rabbis continued to use Hartsoeker's image centuries later attempting to prove that artificial interference with an embryo or birth was murder, destruction of life.[8] Western nations such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia have made many advances in fields such as IVF, however, places like the Far East do not show nearly as much interest in the topic. Eastern philosophy has its own outlook on issues regarding \"playing God\", such as the Confucianism school of thought.[9] This provides another angle of analysis that can be offered towards this complicated matter. Nature[edit] Climate and weather is also a factor that scientists have been looking into that humans could control, with terraforming and cities around the world that are made from scratch and planned out including their geography. Geo-engineering is an example of changing the planet that many deem to be unnatural and against God.[10] It involves large-scale manipulation of our Earth's natural elements such as the seas, skies, or even atmosphere to counteract against certain environmental issues such as climate change. The debate among scholars is an ongoing battle, where some are trying to bring awareness to the many critical questions that need to be asked when recognizing the different morality positions. When focusing on climate engineering and changing the very critical environment that God has provided, you need to have a plan for when engineering our climate takes a dark turn. You have to think about who are the vulnerable people who are going to be affected by the unperceived consequences. With climate engineering, people are left to question the religious morality of what the human role is when looking at the grand scheme of the universe. Climate change and geo-engineering brings in the concept of the \"playing God\" critique when dealing with policy changes. The critique on \"playing God\" refers to the idea that the human species should not be allowed to manipulate our planet, in a way that undermines human's conventional involvement and action with the world around us. Many new technological advances, such as the more recent AI or gene modifications, are just a few examples, that feed on the idea of humans \"playing God\" or arrogantly undertaking power that rightfully belongs to both God and the land.[10] Climate engineering once an invention from science fiction is now very real and part of an international political conversation. More extreme practices of climate engineering include stimulating phytoplankton blooms in the ocean by seeding iron to absorb excessive carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, to spraying aerosols in the skies to give clouds the maximum reflectivity and brighten them.[10] Artificial intelligence[edit] Deep Blue, a computer similar to this one defeated chess world champion Garry Kasparov in May 1997. It is the first computer to win a match against a world champion. Photo taken at the Computer History Museum. Artificial intelligence has been a frequent topic of moral questioning in the 21st century. Many deem the human creation of another dimension where the being is sentient and possibly near identical to human intelligence to be an act of playing God.[11] Contrary to bioethics and geo-engineering, artificial intelligence does not physically intervene in nature and its processes. Since the invention of the Internet and complex computing systems and algorithms, artificial intelligence has exponentially improved and is now used in everyday technology. The term \"artificial intelligence\" contrasts that of natural intelligence, displayed by biological organisms. Major organisations around the world, including the United Nations, have commented on the relationship between artificial intelligence and the impact it may have on human lives in a negative way. UN Secretary-General António Guterres noted that AI drone strikes have the capability to possibly go rogue and take lives without human involvement. Other practices of AI can include many other matters, such as Deep Blue, the IBM supercomputer that is capable of beating grandmasters at chess. Debate[edit] There is a strong debate regarding morality and the consequences of science and playing God. Gene editing is a big topic that has been the centre of the argument for decades.[12] Many religious figures believe the notion that life is the plan of God and not to be taken away or synthetically given by man, while some scientists argue that if humans are able to do so then God must have meant it to be. Genetic modification[edit] The bioethical debate regarding genetic modification in food and humans has many arguments for and against. In the UK, 4% of the half a million children born have life-affecting genetic defects.[13] This includes genetic diseases that can lead to early death, long-term mental issues, or a lifetime of debilitating physical health problems. Many scientists and supporters of genetic modification argue that DNA is not sacred, and is in fact just chemical sequences in an organism. DNA down to the microscope is just atoms made of elements just like any other living or non-living matter. The University of Pennsylvania in 2016 used mice with a genetic liver disease and were able to genetically edit the mice at birth so that they did not have this deadly disease.[13] It is also argued that since humans are part of nature, then all actions of humanity are technically natural.[14] A beaver building a dam is considered natural, a bird building a nest is also considered natural, so therefore the activities of humans are also natural and a result of autonomy and free will.[14] This argument deduces that certain animals evolved with special traits to assist with their survival and humans developed the special trait of technological advancement. A common argument against genetic editing especially that of children is the designer baby argument. Designer babies would be children who have been created to be stronger, smarter, possibly more attractive, and with many other desirable traits. This would be a technology that would only be accessible to the rich according to opponents of genetic editing and would create a big divide in society between the rich and the poor not only in wealth status but also in physical appearance and physical ability.[13] The non-secular aspect of opposition to genetic modification is the idea that genetic modification and editing is a step further than selective breeding and an area humanity should not trespass in. King Charles III strongly opposes genetically modified crops and states that mixing genetic materials from different species is dangerous and a matter we should not delve into.[14] It is argued that the crucial boundary between humanity's choice and chance is reliant on the spine of ethics and morality; a minor shift in boundary could cause serious harm to the future of society. Geo-engineering[edit] With climate change, and what some perceive to be a difficulty in international cooperation regarding the matter, scientists in some countries are discussing the possibilities of geo-engineering and how it would help their environment. Many secular and even non-secular individuals advocate against geo-engineering and altering the climate simply because the perceived risks are too great.[14] Due to the lack of understanding from humans regarding the consequences of putting different chemicals into the atmosphere or seeding oceans, opponents of geo-engineering suggest it be abandoned (Hartman, 2017). However, climate scientists who support the geo-engineering idea such as Ken Caldeira of Stanford University, suggest that instead of abandoning the idea due to risk, there should be continued research for the consequences of geo-engineering so that the exact probabilities and effects of consequences are understood.[14] Scientists also argue that geo-engineering in some instances can be cheaper and quite financially feasible; however, the opposition to this is that it is a mere quick fix that moves attention away from the development of long-term solutions[citation needed]. Artificial intelligence[edit] Scientists in the past few years have been attempting to create advanced artificial intelligence that seeks to rival our behaviours and learning capabilities.[15] Google's cat experiment involved a network of computers, which learned the concept of a cat despite the fact it had never been told the semantics of what a cat was nor even syntax. Semantics and syntax are important factors regarding artificial intelligence because there is a debate over whether machines are purely syntax and just inserted algorithms and codes that require human activity for them to work. Some fear that syntax will evolve into semantics over time and that machines will learn to have feelings and behaviours similar to that of a human. There is a theory that evolvable matter something considered dead or without emotions is capable of coming to life.[15] This theory hypothesises that non-carbon life could possibly follow the same rules of evolution as humans or any other organism however this has not been tested and is only an idea thus far. There are also many who fear that artificial intelligence will allow for human body modification where parts will be accessible such as a new arm or leg for certain purposes. However, those who support artificial intelligence will argue this is a benefit for society because people with organ diseases, for example, will be able to have a new kidney or liver and prosthetic limbs already exist and are widely used by amputees or people born without a limb.[15] The main consensus amongst the anti-artificial intelligence idea is that the more powerful it becomes, the more powerless we are to control it.[11] Those in favour argue that it is there to aid us and it is not necessary for it to eclipse humanity's intelligence and ability.

Good fiction, especially science fiction, can be prophetic, not because the writer has some mystical way of reading the future, but because, as Southern Catholic novelist Flannery O’Connor once wrote, “prophecy is a matter of seeing near things with their extensions of meaning and thus of seeing far things close up.” Audiences turned out in record numbers this past summer to see Jim Caviezel’s film Sound of Freedom, which exposed the tremendous global evil of child trafficking. But areas of domestic policy deserve similar concern, as American politics is currently suspended over an abyss, with a bipartisan board unwilling to recommend ending surveillance of US citizens despite noted partisan abuse by the FBI, and an executive order (apparently ghostwritten in part by Barack Obama) aimed at “harnessing [Artificial Intelligence] for good” by eliminating its potential use for “disinformation.” Americans looking for a bit of domestic political prophecy should watch Caviezel’s TV serial Person of Interest (2011–2016). Caviezel is most known for his portrayal of Jesus in Mel Gibson’s The Passion of Christ (2004), but Person of Interest involves a different manner of ”playing God.” In the series, directed by Jonathan Nolan, Caviezel plays John Reese, an ex-CIA agent, washed-up and on the brink of suicide before he’s given a job (and more importantly, a purpose) by Harold Finch, played by Michael Emerson. Finch is a reclusive billionaire who, as we find out, in the wake of September 11, created an AI for the US government, designed to prevent future terrorist attacks. Not only an incredible technical mind, Finch also has a delicate moral conscience, and builds what he refers to as “The Machine” as a closed system, such that it only submits to a secret executive branch department the social security numbers of potential domestic terrorists when it senses an imminent danger, creating a list of relevant threats to national security. As Finch later says, the Machine is a shield, not a sword: it’s built so that the government cannot use it to directly target specific people. What begins as a relatively simple police serial with a twist thus becomes a complicated multi-plot vehicle, in part for extended reflection on the ethics of AI creation and its use in government surveillance. While Finch’s virtuous design prevents his Machine from being abused by the black-ops team which uses its intelligence, other engineers are neither as clever nor as ethical. One of the show’s major plot lines reveals the danger of such technology without Finch’s concern for its abuse, as a private corporation, Decima Technologies, aims to bring online a rival AI, Samaritan, in partnership with the government. A major theme of the show during this arc (and this well before the public-private free speech policing of the 2020 election so well documented by Ben Weingarten) is in fact the grave potential of partnerships between governmental and so-called “private” entities to endanger the liberties and the common good of the American people. This danger is one about which the show’s libertarian House Representative Roger McCourt is unable to care: as long as the government isn’t violating the people’s civil liberties, he’s unworried about corporate collusion with the state. It matters little to McCourt that Decima is paying him off with stock tips. On principle, he stands with them and would do no other. His is an anti-political (therefore anti-democratic) pro-corporate stance that refuses to countenance the way that corporate non-state actors can damage the public square, virtual and real, by digitally “indexing, ordering, and controlling the lives of ordinary people.” As powerful actors within our country, corporations developing AI will have some relationship with the government, but it remains to be seen what that will be. The action of the show’s individual episodes reveals that while the people’s representatives and their corporate partners aim at control, Finch and Reese are concerned precisely with serving the good of individual persons. With the amount of information the Machine sees, it predicts not only relevant threats but also crimes “irrelevant” for government purposes—every day planned murders, kidnappings, and fraud. Finch and Reese act, day in and day out, to identify numbers from the ”irrelevant” list, who may be victims or perpetrators of grave crimes, and to prevent evil from coming to pass wherever they can act. What viewers come to see across the span of the show is that for Finch, no man, woman, or child is ”irrelevant,” but as human persons, they have a unique dignity that is worth protecting even at great cost. It is his commitment to this Christian understanding of the person (even as religion is rarely mentioned within the show) as opposed to the pagan conception regaining traction in our society which grounds his partnership with John and others, and which distinguishes their vigilantism from the illegal acts of other groups in the show, such as the libertarian privacy terrorist group Vigilance, the new gang called the Brotherhood, or the government project Northern Lights which acts on intelligence provided by the Machine. This understanding of the unique worth, history, and destiny of human persons is reflected not only by Finch’s choices, but by narrative choices made about the show. While Sound of Freedom reveals a careful examination of heroism, Person of Interest weaves together parallel but divergent character arcs so as to reflect on the paths into or out of nihilism, the philosophical despair that the world fundamentally lacks meaning without human strife to create it. This is certainly an important theme in our own time, where the nihilistic left melts down statues of the conquered (soon to include the American founders, no doubt), fights with police to support the Hamas-led genocide of Jews, and, not content with having turned one state into an infanticide regime by the use of out-of-state lobbying groups, funded by leftist billionaires like Michael Bloomberg and George Soros, take aim at another state, one controlled by Republicans. Christians on the Right are confronting a different kind of nihilism, the Nietzschean vitalism propounded by Bronze Age Pervert, the pseudonym associated with a former Yale Politics PhD student, whose disciples tend to ally politically with conservative-populists as members of the nascent dissident right, but whose spiritual beliefs are more fundamentally aligned with the paganism of the left. While nihilism on the left poses both a physical and psychological threat to the character of our republic (if we can keep it), right-nihilists, if they do not change their master, as Dan Mahoney recently suggested, might corrupt the spiritual character of the American citizenry in an inverted but no less dangerous way. Person of Interest reveals not only political problems pressing in our own day but also the human dynamics which create and potentially resolve them. The emergence of the rival AI, Samaritan, shows that the morality of these technologies depends a great deal on that of their creators: the question, to borrow from investor Nate Fischer, is “who will catechize the bots?” That Samaritan and the Machine regard human beings in a fundamentally different way is revealed in an episode titled “The Cold War,” where the two AIs’ analog interfaces, a child named Gabriel and a woman with the alias Root, meet for a conversation. Samaritan sees humans as fundamentally broken beings who only make broken systems, claiming that the world humans have built is “a cesspool of crime, corruption, and poverty; where there isn’t war, there’s greed, where there isn’t greed, there’s hunger.” When the Machine responds that humanity can’t be changed, Samaritan agrees, but claims it can “reshape their reality.” “Human beings,” Samaritan claims, “need structure lest they wind up destroying themselves” and promises to provide the firm hand of a god, who like Hobbes’s Leviathan, by possessing supreme power can end the civil strife of wars caused by conflicting beliefs, whether religious or ideological. Samaritan implies that its apotheosis will be voluntarily provided, that humans will want to believe in it. In a line that might have come from G. K. Chesterton’s The Everlasting Man, the Machine retorts, “I have come to learn that there is little difference between gods and monsters,” cognizant as it is of the temptations it has encountered to violate its moral code. The Machine, while aware of human fallibility, is also conscious of the grandeur of human free will and desires to preserve human agency in the world, whereas Samaritan embraces a nihilistic anthropology, considering humans as simply power-hungry, money-grubbing animals that need to be utterly ruled by a higher power if they are to transcend their own vice. In a world where competing AIs are already a reality, we should ask what worldview those creating such systems espouse, and how their morality might affect its programming, as the Machine’s character is largely determined by Finch’s own. An episode in the show’s final season reveals clearly the impact that Finch’s character has on others around him, such as Root, the rogue female hacker and his former adversary. She would have become more like Samaritan’s prophet had she not met and worked with Finch. Root, when a child named Samantha Groves, witnessed the essential corruption of the adult world, unwilling to listen to children when the lives of their friends are at stake, simply because of concupiscent desire. In response, she takes her technical talent and works for the highest bidder, earning herself power and money, not hesitating to kill or destroy families in the process and exemplifying a kind of libertarian nihilism: the only value she sees is in what she can gain for herself. However, her time spent with Harold and the Machine shows her human dignity, not in the abstract, but as a real way of living in the world, and her friendship with Finch’s group leads her to the highest form of love, sacrificing herself for her friend. By contrast, Greer, the nemesis of the latter half of the series, was once an MI6 agent, who, after discovering that his superior officer was taking money from the Soviets, despairs of the idea of loyalty to the nation. He declares the nation-state obsolete, and later works to subject humanity as a whole to the supposed wisdom of an omniscient AI. “We are all men without a country now,” a young Greer tells his superior as he points a pistol at the older man’s chest. “These invisible lines we draw on the world—I realize they have no meaning. No one else has any loyalty to his homeland, so why should I? One day, these invisible lines will be erased, and the wars between nations will be as antiquated as this agency.” Greer’s progressive-globalist optimism rests upon a nihilistic understanding of human nature and our relationship to our patria; when the techno-elites of our time, who espouse similar beliefs, that which Dan Mahoney and Pierre Manent call “the religion of humanity,” develop incredibly powerful AI platforms and take it upon themselves to construct powerful AI systems, we should believe that the bots will be built in their image, crafted to rule the American people they consider mere hoi polloi. Thus the show reveals not only political problems pressing in our own day but also the human dynamics that create and potentially resolve them. Perhaps what the United States needs in the midst of our current woes is not a Protestant Franco or a Red Caesar but what our Constitution is designed for, “a moral and religious people,” of which Harold Finch and his friends provide a passing likeness. Alex Taylor Person of Interest foresaw the future of AI and the potential problems of privacy, democracy, and human nature.

You have probably noticed that one of the neural networks keeps showing in the news. Everyone is talking about the incredible abilities of new technologies. And some professionals are already using the capabilities of artificial intelligence for work tasks.Have you read the open letter calling to stop AI systems’ development beyond GPT-4? Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, and more than 1,000 other competent personalities have already signed this petition.The progress is so tremendous that it seriously worries quite a few people. Most likely, we still don’t fully realize what a revolution has happened before our eyes.The two most well-known neural networks in the general public are Midjourney and ChatGPT.But this is just the tip of the iceberg available to each of us.Let’s discuss neural networks and see if people can “play god” with artificial intelligence. And to make the article more visual, we will also ask the opinion of ChatGPT on some issues.Why the topic of neural networks won’t lose relevance in the upcoming decadesIt doesn’t matter what we want or what petitions we sign. We’re already at the edge of a new life. We’ll have to get used to living side by side with artificial intelligence.Alan Turing is an icon associated with AI. In 1950, he proposed his famous Turing test in the article 'Computing Machines and the Mind'.This empirical test aims to understand how closely the capabilities of artificial intelligence resemble those of the human mind. In the test, a participant interacts with both a machine and a human, and based on their responses, the researcher must determine which of the two they’re communicating with.Machines have come a long way since 1950, and today we can no longer definitively say that neural networks cannot pass the Turing test. ChatGPT, for example, believes it can converse like a human, although it remains modest when discussing its abilities.We are confident that interest in neural networks won’t disappear because we live in their era. Even if development stops today, existing solutions are sufficient for practical use and future discoveries.The question of 'why the topic of neural networks will be relevant in the next decades' can be compared to the question of 'why the topic of electricity will be relevant in the next decades'. Neural networks are already with us, and we have to accept this fact and monitor the pace of their development.Research shows that the global neural network market was valued at $14.35 billion in 2020 and will reach $152.61 billion by 2030. That is, the researchers assume a growth of 26.7% within a decade.Undoubtedly, the demand for neural networks isn’t going to diminish. These systems have the potential to simplify our lives and work significantly. However, at the same time, they may also displace many specialists from their jobs.Neural network capabilitiesChatGPT can write code.The first application, written by a neural network and slightly edited by a person, has already appeared in the AppStore. Developer Morten Just told the neural network what he wants to get. And GPT-4 wrote the code for the 5 Movies application according to his description. Morten Just only had to finalize the regulation by 2-5%.Is it possible that coding will soon be accessible to most people? At least, the neural network can now perform tasks previously in the domain of novice programmers.Midjourney, DALL-E, and other neural networks can draw.Drawings of neural networks are almost impossible to distinguish from real photos or art. So neural networks can replace novice designers. DALL-E recently created the world’s first AI-generated cover for the famous Cosmopolitan magazine. Similarly, a machine can be trained to design websites or social media posts.As people have become more familiar with neural networks, a movement of artists has arisen in opposition to AI, which turned into a large-scale movement on thematic websites.Neural networks can communicate.As Chat-GPT has previously claimed, it can mimic human communication. As a result, in the future, neural networks may replace call center workers and online store consultants. Just imagine an employee who can instantly learn all the positions listed on a website along with their characteristics.This employee could then use this knowledge to suggest items that are often picked together and provide recommendations to new customers. Such an employee would be a neural network.Neural networks are great at analytics.Moreover, the neural network can quickly analyze large amounts of information and issue appropriate verdicts. The skills of machines will be instrumental in the economic environment. Perhaps neural networks will replace accountants, financial analysts, business managers, and other professionals.Neural networks never get tired.If you entrust the neural network with monotonous work, it will be doing it around the clock.Artificial intelligence is the intelligence of the whole world.Therefore, neural networks do an excellent job translating texts into foreign languages, deciphering documents, etc.If you ask the GPT-4 neural network what it thinks about its impact on the labor market, it will answer the following:And the neural network is right. Since the topic of artificial intelligence has already begun and will continue to develop, we have to adapt to the new realities. And those who don’t take the latest development seriously risk falling far behind a progressive society.Therefore, let’s understand the types of artificial intelligence. You have probably heard about AI, machine learning, and neural networks. What is the difference between them?Artificial Intelligence vs. Machine Learning vs. Neural NetworksInformation about AI and neural networks has long gone beyond the scope of IT. People talk and discuss technology a lot. Therefore, more terms that can distort perception must be clarified.The concepts of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and neural networks are different, but all these units are interconnected:The broadest concept is artificial intelligence.AI is the ability of a machine to mimic human behavior. Prediction and optimization are among the most common applications of artificial intelligence.Machine learning is one of the branches of artificial intelligence.It’s responsible for creating methods that improve the performance of tasks. Developing machine learning algorithms can be explained via the analogy of teaching a person different knowledge and skills. With the help of machine learning, AI tries to replicate the learning process of a human and pretend to be human.Deep learning is also a critical component of the development of AI.The algorithms of how deep learning works are the same as in machine learning. But what makes deep learning unique? It imposes more extensive data requirements and minimizes human intervention. The algorithm can learn from its own mistakes and requires a large amount of information to do so. At the same time, conventional machine learning has a more straightforward structure.Neural networks are a subfield of machine learning.The neural network is similar to the human brain because its creators tried to replicate the functionality of neural connections. Neural networks perform the same tasks as the brain: collect, store, structure and categorize data, and find similarities. Based on this data, machine learning will take place.Just in case, let’s check with ChatGPT how it identifies itself.But since we’re discussing human interaction with neural networks, let’s talk more about their current and future use.Current fields of application of neural networksNeural networks are very good at analyzing images and other types of information. Neural networks have no problems with storing large amounts of data, structuring, and processing them. These positive qualities are easy to use in many areas, which we will discuss now.Image recognitionNeural networks can recognize objects in images and correlate the information received with other photos. For example, a neural network that has studied many pictures of cats can quickly identify a cat in a photo it has never seen. Conversely, neural networks can create new images of any object. For example, This Person Does Not Exist can indefinitely generate the faces of non-existent people.Image recognition is a practical option that helps people find the names of unknown objects, identify animals or plants, etc.One of the applications of neural networks is face recognition. Facial recognition systems scan and compare a person’s face with other images. Thus, neural networks can identify anyone whose data is on the web.This area of application of neural networks causes fierce ethical debate. On the one hand, the functionality can help identify criminals and restore the history of people who have lost their memory. On the other hand, in states with a non-democratic system of government, this option can be used for political persecution.Analysis of financial marketsNeural networks are excellent at analyzing information by comparing facts. Therefore, with the help of neural networks, market risks can be significantly reduced. The Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm can successfully predict the behavior of stocks, considering past performance, market conditions, global events, and other factors. Thus, you can expect economic situations of any scale to take care of minimizing risks in advance.Social mediaNeural networks are already actively studying social media and analyzing massive databases. By examining user behavior, neural networks can predict which users may leave the site soon and which will gain popularity.Companies already use neural networks to target ads based on demographics, interests, and user behavior. Also, with the help of artificial intelligence, the content shown to the user is personalized.Some companies already trust neural networks to moderate images and other information. Thus, the algorithms detect and remove inappropriate and offensive content.You can also ask the neural network to create a unique image for a post or music for an ad or video that doesn’t need to be copyrighted.Space explorationNeural networks have already captured some of the tasks that relate to aerospace engineering. Artificial intelligence can diagnose malfunctions, serve as an autopilot, and ensure the safety of systems. With the help of neural networks, specialists modulate potential dynamic simulations.LogisticsNeural networks can lay out more profitable communication paths by analyzing large amounts of information. Algorithms will be tuned to minimize the time and cost of passing specific segments. At the same time, neural networks can explore thousands of factors: weather conditions, road traffic, vehicle dimensions, type of cargo carried, and much more.Due to their excellent analytical qualities, the United States uses neural networks for defense and military operations. The US, UK, and Japan are already using neural networks to analyze attacks, determine the location of objects, as well as to develop military strategies and predict results.HealthcareNeural networks have already become excellent assistants for doctors. Today, experts use neural networks to detect X-rays and analyze ultrasound.Imagine that a specially designed neural network can accurately identify a disease from a photo of a problem area, a set of symptoms, and a medical record.Even ChatGPT, just an AI linguistic model, can suggest a diagnosis based on symptoms.Neural networks can provide complete information about the disease and advice on treatment. Researchers use neural networks to discover new drugs because neural networks can analyze how chemical elements will interact with each other.SearchToday, people often use neural networks to find the information they need. You don’t need to make a special request and search among many articles to find the answer to a question through neural network algorithms. The neural network can formulate a clear, concise, and utterly relevant response.In addition, with the help of algorithms, you can find a movie or a book by plot, characters, or any other event. In general, the possibilities are endless. However, don’t forget that you shouldn’t accept all answers as truth.Of course, these are far from all areas of application for neural networks. Every specialist can probably figure out how artificial intelligence will help him. Could we have thought of such simple access to all the world’s knowledge before?Of course, omnipotent neural networks cause a lot of ethical discussion. Let’s talk about them at the end of our article.The ethical matterPeople create neural networks “in their image”. When developing, experts were inspired by the work of the human brain and pursued the goal of creating a machine that completely imitates a person. Therefore, assuming that people “play God” with neural networks is natural.Neural networks don’t have emotions and creative thinking (yet). They accumulate all the information in the world and tend to act according to logic.However, many people are afraid of neural networks and their further development. For example, recently, there was a story about how a neural network pretended to be a visually impaired person and hired a freelancer to complete a captcha. This fact suggests that a person can lose control over the neural network without proper management.The thought of the rise of machines is alarming to humanity. In addition, people raise the following ethical questions:Bias. Neural networks study a large amount of information, among which false or offensive takes can be caught. This fact can lead to discrimination against certain groups of people. Also, when asking a neural network a question, you cannot be sure of its 100% accuracy because you don’t know how carefully the AI studied the information.Confidentiality. Many people fear that someone can use their communication with the neural network to collect personal data.Religious disputes. Some religious groups are becoming opponents of AI. Some people are confused by the concept of a neural network as a humanoid creature. Also, religious denominations fear neural networks can undermine religious beliefs and values.Political debate. People fear governments can use AI to misinform the population and manipulate public opinion. Politicians can use deep fakes to run dirty political campaigns. Totalitarian regimes can use neural networks for surveillance and political persecution.Neural networks are indeed a remarkable phenomenon. But in the wrong hands, they can bring a lot of trouble. The same thing can be said about many concepts in our lives. Ultimately, the splitting of the atom led to the emergence of nuclear power plants that give cheap energy, but the creation and further use of nuclear bombs didn’t take long as well.We truly hope that neural networks and other technologies of that kind will lead us to a fantastic new life and won’t harm us.ConclusionWe already live in the era of AI and neural networks. Their development captures and sometimes frightens society. But any professional should study or at least be aware of neural networks these days. We will have to get along with artificial intelligence, so assessing its capabilities today is necessary.Here at Vilmate we always keep track of modern tendencies and try to spread the limits of our Services.
