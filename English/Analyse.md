The author talks about how America has always been divided, using historical stuff and what Todd Gitlin, a sociologist, said. They say a unified nation is like a made-up story, pointing to things like the Civil War, debates on industry, immigration, women voting, and protests.

America being a mix of different people without a shared story apparently makes things worse. Gitlin thinks the country is together more because of beliefs than having one identity. The Declaration of Independence is a big deal, showing common beliefs. The Fourth of July is seen as a way for those left out to claim they're part of the country and be free and equal.

Using history examples, like women in 1848 making a declaration, makes the argument stronger. Saying the labor movement was into the Fourth of July before Labor Day existed supports the idea that this day mattered in different social and political movements.

Frederick Douglass's old view from 1852, questioning freedom and justice in the Declaration of Independence, is brought in. This is tied to current stuff like Black Lives Matter, showing a long fight for justice.

The author kind of puts together historical events, what experts say, and themes to make a sort of convincing story. Quotes from experts like Gitlin and Shannon make it sound more real, and history examples help are deep in its history, challenging the idea of a totally united nation.

In a nutshell, the writer mixes history, what some experts say, and themes to tell a story that says America has always been split. They use historical examples to make it sound true and quotes from experts to make it more convincing. The whole point is to say that America's problems go way back and that the idea of everyone being perfectly united is pretty much a joke.
